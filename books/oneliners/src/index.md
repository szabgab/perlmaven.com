# Perl Oneliners

Perl is a fantastic language that unfortunately has been eclipsed by other more popular langauges.

Despite the lack of popularify for application programming Perl is still ubiquitous, you can use it everywhere for small tasks.

Even if you are not planning to use it to develop your next big application and even if you are not going to learn the depth of the language my hope that
this book will provide you with useful oneliners that you can use as a helper tool for your daily tasks.
