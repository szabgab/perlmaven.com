Exercise: number guessing game


Create a simple command line game guessing a whole number.

* Let the computer "think" about a whole number between 1-200 using the rand() function.
* Let the user guess a number.
* Tell the user if his guess was bigger or smaller than the number the computer "thought" of or tell him if he hit the right number.
* At this point the user only has one guess, though as a bounus you can allow the user to guess several times.
