* [Perl Mongers International](http://www.pm.org/) where Jay is the chief ticket monkey
* [Perl Mongers in Omaha, Nebraska](http://omaha.pm.org/) that Jay basically folded into the [Omaha Dynamic Language User Group](http://odlug.org/)
* [Des Moines, Iowa](http://desmoines.pm.org/) and
      [Kansas City, Missouri](http://kc.pm.org/) are two near-by Perl Monger groups.
* 55 Fahrenheit is 12.7778 Celsius. It is rather cold for bike riding :)
* [jays.net](http://jays.net) for all things Jay. Or:

* The Perl Mongers IRC channel: #mongers on irc.perl.org
* [www.pm.org on github.com](https://github.com/perlorg/www.pm.org/)
* Apparently Jay works at [Infinity Interactive](http://www.iinteractive.com/) too,
     together with [John Anderson (genehack)](/john-sj-anderson-genehack) and [Stevan Little](/stevan-little).
     He'll be at [YAPC::NA](http://www.yapcna.org/yn2013/) too helping with the
     [master classes](http://www.yapcna.org/yn2013/training.html) of the other two.
* Perspective:
* Jay: Omaha is a fairly small town
* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha): Omaha's population was 408,958, making it the nation's 42nd-largest city.
