Some times ago I have noticed that the Perl Maven site got slower. I thought it might mean I have outgrown the server.
Or maybe the the new calls to the MongoDB backend are causing the problem. I even checked what would it cost
to upgrade the <a href="/linode">Linode</a> I have, but as I did not know what is the real source of the problem,
I was not sure that would help.

=abstract end

<h2>Prepare for profiling</h2>

The proper thing to do in this case is to try to find out what is the source of the long processing.
In order to do that I wrote a small script that would load a single page.
My site is using <a href="/dancer">Dancer</a> and it has an <hl>app.psgi</hl> file that could be used to launch Dancer
via any <a href="/psgi">PSGI</a> compliant server.

I wrote a small program, similar to how a test-script would look like that loads a single page. (Just the HTML part.)

<include file="examples/psgi_profiling.pl">

It loads the <hl>app.psgi</hl> file using <hl>do</hl>. As per the requirement of any such file, it returns a reference
to a function that represents the application. Then we use <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Test">Plack::Test</a>
to provide an environment for the application and finally we use the <hl>GET</hl> function of
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Request::Common">HTTP::Request::Common</a> to send in a request.

<h2>Run the profiler</h2>

Once the above program was ready I ran the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::NYTProf">Devel::NYTProf</a> profiler with
the following command:

<code>
perl -d:NYTProf  psgi_profiling.pl
</code>

This created a file called <hl>nytprof.out</hl>

Then I ran

<code>
nytprofhtml
</code>

which generated a beautiful HTML report.

That report clearly showed that most of the time was spent executing various functions of
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML">YAML</a>.

<h2>Replace YAML by YAML::XS</h2>

I don't have a benchmark for YAML vs YAML::XS, but it seems to be obvious that
the latter will be much faster. Just as
<a href="/comparing-the-speed-of-json-decoders">JSON::XS is much faster than JSON</a>

So I decided to give it a try and replaced YAML by <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::XS">YAML::XS</a>
in the whole code.

Though I thought they are fully compatible it turned out that there are several
<a href="/yaml-vs-yaml-xs-inconsistencies">constructs that YAML allows and YAML::XS rejects</a>. Luckily the tests I had complained.
Then I spent about 2 hours trying to figure out the specific issues. The fix was easy, just locating
the files was difficult. Maybe that too could be explained by the fact that I did this at 2 am
after a full day of work.

Once I finished, I ran the profiler again and was happy to see the YAML calls are almost totally gone.

In the morning I've deployed the new version.

This is what the <a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin graphs</a> show half a day later:

<h2>Request processing time</h2>

It went down from an average of 2-3 to almost nothing.
The graph shows the last 24 hours. The green line shows the average request processing time in the preceding 5 minutes.
It dropped immediately once I deployed the new version. The blue line shows the average of the past 24 hours. It will
catch up with the green line in 24 hours.

<h2>CPU load</h2>

At the same time the CPU load also went down.

So based on this I won't need to upgrade the server any time soon, but probably more importantly,
you the reader will get much better response time from the server.
