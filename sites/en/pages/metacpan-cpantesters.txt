=abstract start

Every CPAN module comes with unit-tests. When you install a module the tests are executed. You can configure your cpan client to send
this report to the <a href="http://cpantesters.org/">CPAN Tester</a> who will collect and display the reports.
<a href="https://metacpan.org/">Meta CPAN</a> displays the total number of test reports for each CPAN distribution.
