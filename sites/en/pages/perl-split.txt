PHP has the <hl>explode</hl> function,
Python, Ruby and JavaScript all have <hl>split</hl> methods.

In Perl the function is called <hl>split</hl>.

<h2>Syntax of split</h2>

<hl>split REGEX, STRING</hl> will split the STRING at every match of the REGEX.

<hl>split REGEX, STRING, LIMIT</hl> where LIMIT is a positive number. This will split the the STRING at every match of the REGEX, but will stop after it found LIMIT-1 matches.
So the number of elements it returns will be LIMIT or less.

<hl>split REGEX</hl> - If STRING is not given, splitting the content of
<a href="/the-default-variable-of-perl">$_, the default variable of Perl</a> at every
match of the REGEX.

<hl>split</hl> without any parameter will split the content of <hl>$_</hl> using <hl>/\s+/</hl> as REGEX.

<h2>Simple cases</h2>

<hl>split</hl> returns a list of strings:

<code lang="perl">
use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);

my $str = "ab cd ef gh ij";
my @words = split / /, $str;
print Dumper \@words;
</code>

The output is:

<code>
$VAR1 = [
          'ab',
          'cd',
          'ef',
          'gh',
          'ij'
        ];
</code>

<h2>Limit the number of parts</h2>

<hl>split</hl> can get a 3rd parameter that will limit the number of elements returned:

<code lang="perl">
use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);

my $str = "ab cd ef gh ij";
my @words = split / /, $str, 2;
print Dumper \@words;
</code>

The result:

<code>
$VAR1 = [
          'ab',
          'cd ef gh ij'
        ];
</code>


<h2>Assign to scalars</h2>

Instead of assigning the result to a single array, we can also assign
it to a list of scalar variables:

<code lang="perl">
my $str = "root:*:0:0:System Administrator:/var/root:/bin/sh";
my ($username, $password, $uid, $gid, $real_name, $home, $shell) = split /:/, $str;
print "$username\n";
print "$real_name\n";
</code>

The output is like this:

<code>
root
System Administrator
</code>

Another way people often write this is the following:
First they assign the results to and array, and then they copy the specific 
elements of the array:

<code lang="perl">
my $str = "root:*:0:0:System Administrator:/var/root:/bin/sh";
my @fields = split /:/, $str;
my $username = $fields[0];
my $real_name = $fields[4];
print "$username\n";
print "$real_name\n";
</code>

This is longer and I think less clear.

A slightly better way is to use an <b>array slice</b>:

<code lang="perl">
my $str = "root:*:0:0:System Administrator:/var/root:/bin/sh";
my @fields = split /:/, $str;
my ($username, $real_name) = @fields[0, 4];
print "$username\n";
print "$real_name\n";
</code>

Please note, in the <b>array slice</b> <hl>@fields[0, 4];</hl> we
have a leading <hl>@</hl> and not a leading <hl>$</hl>.


If we are really only interested in the elements 0 and 4, the we could
use array slice on the fly:

<h2>Slice on the fly</h2>


<code lang="perl">
my $str = "root:*:0:0:System Administrator:/var/root:/bin/sh";
my ($username, $real_name) = (split /:/, $str)[0, 4];
print "$username\n";
print "$real_name\n";
</code>

Here we don't build an array, but as we put the whole expression
in parentheses, we can put an index on them and fetch only elements 0 and 4 from
the temporary (and invisible) array that was created for us:
<hl>(split /:/, $str)[0, 4]</hl>


<h2>Split on more complex regex</h2>

The separator of <hl>split</hl> is a regex. So far in the examples we used
the very simple regex <hl>/ /</hl> matching a single space. We can use any regex:
For example if we have strings that look like these:

<code>
fname    = Foo
lname =    Bar
email=foo@bar.com
</code>

We want to split where the <hl>=</hl> sign and disregard the spaces around it.
We can use the following line:

<code lang="perl">
my ($key, $value) = split /\s*=\s*/, $str
</code>

This will include any white-space character around the <hl>=</hl> sign in
the part that cuts the pieces.


<h2>Split on multiple characters</h2>

For example we might have a string built up from
pairs concatenated with <hl>&</hl>. The two parts of
each pair is separated by <hl>=</hl>.

<code lang="perl">
use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);

my $str = 'fname=Foo&lname=Bar&email=foo@bar.com';
my @words = split /[=&]/, $str;
print Dumper \@words;
</code>

<code>
$VAR1 = [
          'fname',
          'Foo',
          'lname',
          'Bar',
          'email',
          'foo@bar.com'
        ];
</code>

Of course, if we know these are key-value pairs, then we might want to assign the
result to a hash instead of an array:

<code lang="perl">
use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);

my $str = 'fname=Foo&lname=Bar&email=foo@bar.com';
my %user = split /[=&]/, $str;
print Dumper \%user;
</code>

And the result looks much better:

<code>
$VAR1 = {
          'fname' => 'Foo',
          'email' => 'foo@bar.com',
          'lname' => 'Bar'
        };
</code>


<h2>Split on empty string</h2>

Splitting on the empty string, or empty regex, if you wish is basically saying
"split at every place where you find an empty string". Between every two characters
there is an empty string so splitting on an empty string will return the original
string cut up to individual characters:

<code lang="perl">
use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);

my $str = "Hello World";
my @chars = split //, $str;

print Dumper \@chars;
</code>

<code>
$VAR1 = [
          'H',
          'e',
          'l',
          'l',
          'o',
          ' ',
          'W',
          'o',
          'r',
          'l',
          'd'
        ];
</code>

<h2>Beware of regex special characters</h2>

A common pitfall with split, especially if you use a string as the separator (<hl>split STRING, STRING</hl>) as in <hl>split ';', $line;</hl>
is that even if you pass the first parameters as a string it still behaves as a regex. So for example

<code>
split '|', $line;
</code>

is the same as

<code>
split /|/, $line;
</code>

and both will split the string character by character. The right way to split on a pipe <hl>|</hl> character is to escape
the special regex character:

<code>
split /\|/, $line;
</code>

<h2>Other examples</h2>

Though in the general case <hl>split</hl> is not the right tool for this job,
it can be employed for <a href="/how-to-read-a-csv-file-using-perl">reading simple CSV files</a>.

It is also a critical part of the example showing
<a href="/count-words-in-text-using-perl">how to count words in a text file</a>.

Another special case helps to <a href="/split-retaining-the-separator">retain the separator or parts of it</a>.
