=abstract start

When searching a Perl module, sooner or later you will end up on one of two sites sites providing information about CPAN modules.
Both <a href="https://metacpan.org/">Meta CPAN</a>, and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/" rel="nofollow">search.cpan.org</a>
will show you a link to <b>download</b> the module, but in most cases that's <b>not</b> what you need.

So how do you really install Perl modules from CPAN?

(As always, some people will disagree with the recommendations below, they probably have not read
the <a href="http://perlhacks.com/2014/03/installing-modules/">article of Dave Cross</a>, or reached
other conclusions.)

=abstract end

In most cases the installation of a CPAN module works just as installing an app from the Apple Appstore or the Google Play.
Except, that these modules are all open source and free software.

Depending on the Operating System and which Perl distribution you have, the specific instructions differ.
In order to make the examples clearer, let's try to install the module called <b>Try::Tiny</b>.

It has its description both on <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Path-Tiny">Meta CPAN</a> and on
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Path-Tiny/" rel="nofollow">search.cpan.org</a>. Both have the <b>Download</b> links
that we won't click on.

<h2 id="dwimperl">Strawberry Perl or DWIM Perl on Windows</h2>

<a href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a>,
comes with an already configured cpan client. We will use this client to install modules directly from CPAN:

Open the Command Window (Start -> Run -> type in cmd) When you get the "DOS" prompt
type in <hl>cpan Path::Tiny</hl>.
Please note, module names are case sensitive,
so typing <hl>cpan path::tiny</hl> or <hl>cpan PATH::TINY</hl> will <b>not</b> work!

Also, in normal circumstances, the cpan client is expecting the full name of the module, not one part of the name,
and not the name of the zip-file.
So <hl>cpan Path</hl> or <hl>cpan Tiny</hl> will attempt to install different modules.
(One called Path, the other one called Tiny.)

What you need to do is type in:

<code>
c:> cpan Path::Tiny
</code>


<h2 id="activeperl">ActivePerl</h2>

There is a graphical tool for this as well, but it might be more simple just to open the
Command Window (Start -> Run -> type cmd). When you get the "DOS" prompt, type in
<hl>ppm install Path::Tiny</hl>. Please note, this too is case sensitive!

<code>
c:> ppm install Path::Tiny
</code>

The problem you might encounter is that this command uses the "CPAN store" of ActiveState that for various
technical and legal reasons does not carry all the the modules from CPAN. It can also be out-of date
carrying older versions of the modules. On newer versions of ActivePerl you can also enable a real
cpan-client that will access the CPAN server just as it does in the case of Strawberry/DWIM Perl above.

<h2 id="debian">Debian/Ubuntu Linux</h2>

If you have <b>root</b> rights, and if you use the <b>system perl</b> located in <hl>/usr/bin/perl</hl>,
then probably the best is to try to install from the package management system of your Linux distribution.
If you don't have root rights, you could ask your system administrator to do it on your behalf.

Apparently there is a nice way to <a href="http://deb.perl.it/">find out if a Perl module is on Debian or Ubuntu</a>.

If the module you are looking for is not available in the repositories of your Debian/Ubuntu/etc. distribution
(and there are only about 10% of the modules available), or if you don't use the system Perl,
then you can follow the instructions with <b>cpan/cpanm</b> below.

To install for the system-perl as root you can use either <hl>aptitude</hl> or <hl>apt-get</hl>
depending on your personal preferences.

If the name of the module in Perl-land is <hl>Path::Tiny</hl>, then the name of the package in Debian/Ubuntu-land
is most likely going to be <hl>libpath-tiny-perl</hl>.

<code>
$ sudo apt-get install libpath-tiny-perl
</code>

<code>
$ sudo aptitude install libpath-tiny-perl
</code>



<h2 id="fedora">RedHat/Fedora/CentOS Linux</h2>

Just as in the case of Debian/Ubuntu above, the instructions here are relevant if
you use the <b>system perl</b> located in <hl>/usr/bin/perl</hl> and if you have
<b>root</b> rights:

Using the package management system:

<code>
$ sudo yum install perl-Path-Tiny
</code>

As Dave Cross mentioned, if you don't know the name of the RH package, you can also use

<code>
yum install 'perl(Path::Tiny)'".
</code>

The subtle difference is that the former installs the named RPM whereas the second
installs the RPM that provides the named Perl module.

So if you would like to install the Path::Tiny module then the second command is
actually the better one.

If your vendor does not carry this Perl package, you can add other RPM repositories.
Check out <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">EPEL</a>, and
the <a href="http://rpm.mag-sol.com/">Magnum Solutions CPAN RPM Repository</a>
maintained by <a href="http://perlschool.co.uk/">Dave Cross</a>.


<h2 id="osx">Mac OSX</h2>

Follow the instructions with <b>cpan/cpanm</b> below.

<h2 id="cpan-client">Using the cpan client</h2>

While the <hl>cpan</hl> program comes with most operating system,
and it works well after some configuration, there is probably a better,
and certainly lighter solution called <b>cpan minus</b> or <b>cpanm</b>.


<h2 id="cpanm">Using cpanm</h2>

This is for Linux and OSX systems.  (For Windows, see described above.)

First, if you don't have it installed yet,
then install <a href="http://cpanmin.us">cpan minus</a> by typing

<code>
$ \curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
</code>

Once it is installed type:

<code>
$ cpanm Path::Tiny
</code>

If you still have questions related to the installation of Perl modules,
please ask them below! I'll try to update this article
to answer those questions and to explain other situations.

<h2>TODO</h2>

Separate explanation of installing using cpan/cpanm as root stepping on the system perl, 
using local::lib to install in a private directory while using system perl.

Using a manually compiled perl.

Using perlbrew, creating "virtual environments".
