=abstract start

In the <a href="/introduction-to-regexes-in-perl">previous article</a> we saw how regular characters match themselves and how dot <hl>.</hl> can match any character.

A character class is something in between those two extremes. A character class is a list of characters that can be matched.

The list is placed in square brackets <hl>[]</hl>.

For example <hl>[abc]</hl> will match either 'a' or 'b' or 'c'.

=abstract end

Just as a regular character or a <hl>.</hl> can match exactly one character so does a character class. Later we are going to learn
about quantifiers that will allow us to say how many of something we would like to match, but for now remember that a character
class always matches exactly one character. If it cannot fulfill the match then the whole regex matching fails.

So what if we have a bunch of strings and we would like to make sure only strings containing any of the following will match?
<hl>#a#, #b#, #c#, #d#, #e#, #f#, #@# or #.#</hl>
That is, we would like the string to have a <hl>#</hl> character, followed by 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', '@', or '.', followed by another <hl>#</hl>
character.  (We are using <hl>#</hl> in this example in order to get you used to seeing 'strange' characters that have no <a href="/introduction-to-regexes-in-perl">special meaning</a>.)

The regex that will match those looks like this: <hl>/#[abcdef@.]#/</hl>.

It says: match a <hl>#</hl>, then match any one(!) of the characters in the square bracket, then match another <hl>#</hl>.

this will match

<code>
"#a#"
"ab #z#a# "
"ab #.# "
</code>

but will not match any of the following:

<code>
"ab #q# "
"ab ## "
"##"
"#ab#"
"#aa#"
"# #"
"###"
"#-#"
</code>

Two notes:

<ul>
  <li>The regex won't match "##" or "#ab#" because the character class must match exactly one character between the two '#' characters.</li>
  <li>The '.' inside the character class lost its special meaning of "everything except newline" and can match a single '.' only.</li>
</ul>

In general, most special characters lose their special meaning inside a character class, but there are of course exceptions.
There are even character that gain special meaning inside a character class.

<h2>Range in a character class</h2>

Programmers are lazy typing in all the characters between 'a' and 'f' in the regex <hl>/#[abcdef@.]#/</hl> was really tiring. If we had to type
in all the characters between 'a' and 'z' that would be even worse and it would be very error-prone. What if I miss one of the characters?
Instead of that regexes allow us to define a range of characters from the ASCII table using a dash (<hl>-</hl>). The previous regex
could be written as <hl>/#[a-f@.]#/</hl>

So as you can see a dash <hl>-</hl>, that did not have any special meaning outside of a character class, inside has the special "range-making" meaning.

Of course you will then want to know how can you express that one of the characters you'd like to match in the character class is a dash, and the answer
is that if you place the dash as the first or the last character in the character class, then it will be just a plain dash.
So <hl>/#[a-f@.-]#/</hl> will match all the above and also "#-#".

Another frequently asked question at this point is how to include a closing square bracket <hl>]</hl> in a character class. That's simple too.
You just need to "escape" it be preceding with a back-slash: <hl>\]</hl>.


<h2>Negated character class</h2>

What if we would like to allow the matching of any character between two '#' characters <b>except</b> 'a', 'b', or 'c'? We would need to construct
a character class with all the characters in the world and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">Unicode</a> has more that 110,000 characters.
That would be a lot of work to type in. Instead of that, Perl allows us to negate a character class. If we put a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret">Caret</a>
 (<hl>^</hl>) as the first character in the character class it will mean the character class can match any one character except those mentioned in the character class.
So <hl>[^abc]</hl> would match exactly one character that is not 'a', nor 'b', nor 'c'. Our full regex then would look like <hl>/#[^abc]#/</hl>.

This regex will match these strings:

<code>
"abc #z# z"
"#z#"
</code>

but will <b>not</b> match any of these strings:

<code>
"abc #a# z"
"#xyz#"
"##"
</code>

Note, it won't match the string '##' or the string "#xyz#", because the negated character class still has to match exactly one character.

<h2>Summary</h2>

<code>
/a[bc]a/      # aba, aca
/a[2#=x?.]a/  # a2a, a#a, a=a, axa, a?a, a.a
              # inside the character class most of the spec characters lose their
              # special meaning  BUT there are some new special characters
/a[2-8]a/     # is the same as /a[2345678]a/
/a[2-]a/      # a2a, a-a        - has no special meaning at the ends
/a[-8]a/      # a8a, a-a
/a[6-C]a/     # a6a, a7a ... aCa
              #      characters from the ASCII table: 6789:;<=>?@ABC but this is not recommended, don't use it!
/a[C-6]a/     # syntax error

/a[^xy]a/     # "aba", "aca"  but not "aya", "axa" and remember, not "aa"
              # ^ as the first character in a character class means 
              # a character that is not in the list
/a[b^x]a/     # aba, a^a, axa,  but not aza
</code>

<h2>Comments</h2>

/a[b^x]a/ # aba, a^a, axa, but not aza
I didn't get this.

---
'z' is not in the character class, therefore you cannot match it. It has to match 'a', then any character in the [] ( 'b' or '^' or 'x'), then 'a'. Hope it helps!!!

<hr>

I didn't understand /#[abcdef@.]#/ is matches with string "ab #z#a# ".

Can you please explain this?
