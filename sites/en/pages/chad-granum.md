Fennec can automatically run blocks of you code in separate forked processes.

It can also run a specific block in your test script. Awesome for rapid test development.

An interview with Chad Granum, the author of [Fennec](http://exodist.github.io/Fennec/) and a number of other
interesting CPAN modules.  (31.06 min)
