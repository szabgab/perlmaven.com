Usually when we use <a href="/perl-split">split</a>, we provide a regex.
Whatever the regex matches is "thrown away" and the pieces between these matches are returned.
In this example we get back the two strings even including the spaces.

<include file="examples/split_str.pl">

=abstract end

<code>
$VAR1 = [
          'abc ',
          ' def'
        ];
</code>

If however, the regex contains capturing parentheses, then whatever they captured will be also included
in the list of returned strings. In this case the string of digits '23' is also included.

<include file="examples/split_str_retain.pl">

<code>
$VAR1 = [
          'abc ',
          '23',
          ' def'
        ];
</code>

<h2>Only what is captured is retained</h2>

Remember, not the separator, the substring that was matched, will be retained, but whatever is in
the capturing parentheses.

<include file="examples/split_str_multiple.pl">

<code>
$VAR1 = [
          'abc ',
          '2',
          '3',
          ' def '
        ];
</code>

In this example the <hl>=</hl> sign is not in the resulting list.

<h2>Comments</h2>

That should be obvious. But it wasn’t to me. I can recall a few times I would’ve liked to retain the separators. Another tool for the tool box. Thanks!
