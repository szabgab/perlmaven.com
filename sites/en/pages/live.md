## Next

* 2025.12.01 [Perl Code-reading and testing](https://luma.com/perl-maven)


During this online event we are going to take a look at the JSON::Schema::Validate module ( https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::Schema::Validate  )

We'll try to use it. We'll look at the tests it has etc.

Link to access the event will be provided later.
