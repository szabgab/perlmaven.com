=abstract start

<a href="/yaml">YAML</a> is a great format for configuration files and for data serialization. There are several Perl modules
implementing the function that convert a YAML string into a Perl data structure (deserialize) and that can convert a Perl
data structure into a YAML string (serialize).

=abstract end

<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::Tiny">YAML::Tiny</a> clearly states that it only implements a subset of features,
but as far as I understand YAML and YAML::XS are supposed to be drop-in replacements of each other.
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::Any">YAML::Any</a> is a wrapper
around several YAML processors, though at one point YAML itself will be promoted to do that job.


Yet, when I tried to <a href="/profiling-and-speed-improvement">switch from  YAML to YAML::XS</a> I've encountered two cases of incompatibility.
Probably in both cases the YAML file wasn't according to the specs, but in both cases YAML was forgiving and parsed
the files as I expected them and in both cases YAML::XS threw exception. I've created minimal examples for both cases
and I have tried to parse them with the following:

<ul>
   <li><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML">YAML version 1.15</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::XS">YAML::XS version 0.59</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::Tiny">YAML::Tiny version 1.69</a></li>
   <li><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::Syck">YAML::Syck version 1.29</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Space required after :</h2>

The YAML file:

<include file="examples/files/space_required.yml">

<hl>perl yaml.pl files/space_required.yml</hl>  parsed and created

<code>
$VAR1 = {
          'x' => {
                 'a' => 'a',
                 'b' => 'b'
               }
        };
</code>

<hl>perl yaml_xs.pl files/space_required.yml</hl>

<code>
YAML::XS::Load Error: The problem:

    could not find expected ':'

was found at document: 1, line: 4, column: 1
while scanning a simple key at line: 3, column: 3
</code>

<hl>perl yaml_tiny.pl files/space_required.yml</hl> threw exception:

<code>
YAML::Tiny failed to classify line '  'b':'b'' at yaml_tiny.pl line 11.
</code>

<hl>perl yaml_syck.pl files/space_required.yml</hl> threw exception:

<code>
Syck parser (line 4, column -1): syntax error 
</code>

The solution here is to put a space after the <hl>:</hl> in the line of 'b' as in the following:

<include file="examples/files/space_required_solved.yml">

I am not sure if this is something that needs to be fixed in the YAML module, or just documented,
but I've opened a <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/yaml-pm/issues/152">ticket</a>.

<h2>Value with : needs to be quoted</h2>

The YAML file:

<include file="examples/files/quote_colon.yml">

<hl>perl yaml.pl files/quote_colon.yml</hl> properly parses the YAML file and generates this data structure:

<code>
$VAR1 = {
          'a' => [
                 {
                   'b' => 'c:'
                 }
               ]
        };
</code>

<hl>perl yaml_xs.pl files/quote_colon.yml</hl> throws exception:

<code>
YAML::XS::Load Error: The problem:

    mapping values are not allowed in this context

was found at document: 1, line: 2, column: 9
</code>

<hl>perl yaml_tiny.pl files/quote_colon.yml</hl> throws exception:

<code>
YAML::Tiny found illegal characters in plain scalar: 'c:' at yaml_tiny.pl line 11.
</code>

<hl>perl yaml_syck.pl files/quote_colon.yml</hl> throws exception:

<code>
Syck parser (line 2, column 9): syntax error
</code>

The solution here is to put the value with the <hl>:</hl> in it between single-quote marks:

<include file="examples/files/quote_colon_solved.yml">

Here too I've opened a <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/yaml-pm/issues/153">ticket</a> for consideration.
