=abstract start

When you start writing a project, especially when it is in-house, creating a CPAN distribution might not be high on
your priorities, but having the capability will simplify the use of various tools and services. So I recommend that
you prepare your module/application in a similar way.

=abstract end

We need to create a file called Makefile.PL that holds the list of dependencies of our code and a few other instructions
how to install it. For simple Perl-only modules (that don't include code in C or XS or in some other language), the Makefile.PL
is quite simple and standard.

<include file="examples/markua-parser/79f7a57/Makefile.PL">

For detailed explanation see the <a href="/makefile-pl-of-extutils-makemaker">Makefile.PL of ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a>
and the <a href="/packaging-with-makefile-pl">packaging with Makefile.PL</a> articles.


The first time you run it with <hl>perl Makefile.PL</hl> you'll get a warning:

<code>
WARNING: Setting VERSION via file 'lib/Markua/Parser.pm' failed
</code>

In order to fix this we add the version number to the 'lib/Markua/Parser.pm' file:

<code lang="perl">
our $VERSION = 0.01;
</code>

The whole file can be seen here:

<include file="examples/markua-parser/79f7a57/lib/Markua/Parser.pm">

<h2>Run the tests and generate the distribution</h2>

The following sequence of command will

<ol>
  <li>Check if all the prerequisites are met and generate <hl>Makefile</hl>.</li>
  <li>Rearrange the files in the <hl>blib</hl> subdirectory in the same structure as they will be after installation.</li>
  <li>Run the tests</li>
  <li>Generate the <hl>MANIFEST</hl> that lists all the file that need to be included in the distribution. (This is based on the <hl>MANIFEST.SKIP</hl> file, but we did not need it for the simple case.</li>
  <li>Generate the tar.gz file that can be uploaded to PAUSE or distributed in another way.</li>
</ol>

<code>
$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test
$ make manifest
$ make dist
</code>

<h2>gitignore generated files</h2>

The above process generates a few files and directories that don't need to be in version control.
The best approach is to add their names to the <hl>.gitignore</hl> file so git will ignore them.

This is what I had to create:

<include file="examples/markua-parser/79f7a57/.gitignore">

<code>
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "create Makefile.PL"
</code>
