Every CPAN module comes with unit-tests. When you install a module the tests are executed. You can configure your cpan client to send
this report to the [CPAN Tester](http://cpantesters.org/) who will collect and display the reports.
[Meta CPAN](https://metacpan.org/) displays the total number of test reports for each CPAN distribution.
