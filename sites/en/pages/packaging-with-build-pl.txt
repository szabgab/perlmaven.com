=abstract start

If you use <a href="/build-pl-of-module-build">Build.PL with Module::Build</a> then creating the
distribution file has the following steps:

=abstract end

<slidecast file="advanced-perl/libraries-and-modules/packaging-with-build-pl" youtube="yy9aypG3IiM" />

<code>
perl Build.PL
</code>

will check if the dependencies are there (similar to <hl>perl Makefile.PL</hl> in the case of
<a href="/packaging-with-makefile-pl">Makefile.PL</a>) and create a file called <hl>Build</hl>
without any extension which is just another Perl script.

Then we run

<code>
perl Build
</code>

that will rearrange directories, create the <hl>blib/</hl> directory and copy files there.

The we run

<code>
perl Build test
</code>

that will run all the unit- and other automation tests checking if the distribution is ready.

Then comes the time when you might want to create your <hl>MANIFEST</hl> file.
If you maintain <hl>MANIFEST.SKIP</hl> then at this point you need to run

<code>
perl Build manifest
</code>

that will take all the files in the current directory tree, exclude the onse that
match one of the regexes in <hl>MANIFEST.SKIP</hl> and include the list of the others
in the <hl>MANIFEST</hl> file.

Once you have the up-to-date <hl>MANIFEST</hl> file we can run

<code>
perl Build dist
</code>

to create the zip file.

This is the file you'd distribute either via CPAN or directly to your clients.


<h2>Installing a distribution</h2>

If you want to install one of these distributions, you would run

<code>
perl Build.PL
perl Build
perl Build test
</code>

just as during the creationg of the distribution, but then you'd run

<code>
perl Build install
</code>

to install the files.
