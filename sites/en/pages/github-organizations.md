Most projects are started by a single person in a GitHub repository of that person. Later for various reasons people establish GitHub organizations
and move the projects there.
Sometimes the organization contains a set of sub-projects related to a central project. (e.g. A web framework and its extensions or database access.)
Sometimes it is a collection of projects related to a single topic. (e.g. testing or IDE support.)
Sometimes it is just a random collection of project where people band together in the hope that no project will be left behind. (e.g. the CPAN Authors organization.)

Organizations make it easier to have multiple maintainers and thus ensuring continuity of project, but it might also mean that none of the members really
feel the urge to continue working on something.

In any case, I tried to collect all the Perl-related GitHub organizations.
