Single Page Applications heavily rely on some JavaScript framework and a back-end system that can provide communication using JSON.

<a href="https://code-maven.com/angularjs">AngularJS</a> is a great JavaScript framework (or HTML framework, or whatever you might want to call it),
and <a href="/dancer">Perl Dancer</a> is a nice backend framework.

Recent versions of Dancer2 started to allow custom skeletons which means, we can provide our own skeleton files and the new Dancer-based
application will use those.

=abstract end

The <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/Dancer2-Angular-Skeleton">Dancer2-Angular-Skeleton</a> is such a set of files.

Download the skeleton using the <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/Dancer2-Angular-Skeleton/archive/master.zip">Download ZIP</a> button in
the GitHub Repository. And unzip the file.

<code>
$ wget https://github.com/szabgab/Dancer2-Angular-Skeleton/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ dancer2 -a My::App -s Dancer2-Angular-Skeleton-master
</code>

Due to a bug for which I sent in a <a href="https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer2/pull/1060">pull request already</a> it will complain a bit
with hundreds of rows like this:

<code>
utf8 "\xAC" does not map to Unicode a ...
</code>

but in the end it will create a directory called My-App, and in that directory you'll have Dancer2 application, AngularJS,
and a few lines of code that demonstrates how to get started with a Single-Page Application.

It still needs more work, but I really wanted to show it already.

You can now

<code>
$ cd My-App
$ plackup -R lib bin/app.psgi
</code>

and visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see how does it work.


<h2>Creating your own Dancer2 skeleton</h2>

It is quite easy. You can clone the one I have created, or you can copy the <a href="https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer2/tree/master/share/skel">share/skel</a>
directory from the Dancer2 distribution and tweak it for yourself.
