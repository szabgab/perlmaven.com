Sending email with attachments.


<slidecast file="beginner-perl/send-email-with-attachments" youtube="QjHLbVbs6sY" />

* [File::Basename](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Basename)
* [Pod::Usage](https://metacpan.org/pod/Pod::Usage)
* [Getopt::Long](https://metacpan.org/pod/Getopt::Long)
* [MIME::Lite](https://metacpan.org/pod/MIME::Lite)
* [File::Slurp](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Slurp)

This is a rather old video. Today, I'd  use
[Path::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/Path::Tiny) instead of File::Slurp,
and
[Email::Suffer](https://metacpan.org/pod/Email::Stuffer) instead of MIME::Lite.


## Comments

Thank you for the very informative and well-explanatory video. Can you also explain how this mail is sent encrypted, with for example "Mail::GnuPG"?

With friendly greetings and thank you,
Michael
