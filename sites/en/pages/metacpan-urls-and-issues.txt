=abstract start

<a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> has a standard URL scheme. After the domain name we can type <b>pod/</b> and then the name of a module,
for example <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class">https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class</a> with the <b>::</b> with the correct case. This
will always show the documentation of the latest version of this module.

If we add <b>release/</b> after the domain name and the name of a CPAN release (in the correct case and with - between the words)
then we reach the most recent release of this distribution. For example: <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DBIx-Class">https://metacpan.org/release/DBIx-Class</a>

MetaCPAN also has a link to the <a href="https://rt.cpan.org/">Request Tracker of CPAN</a> where each CPAN distribution has its own queue. The link also
include the number of open bug reports. Module authors might want to use a different bug tracking system. They can tell about it via the
META files in their distribution. Then MetaCPAN will link to this other bug tracking system. For example <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/MongoDB">MongoDB</a>
uses a Jira installation.
