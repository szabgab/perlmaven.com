=description Twiggy is an asynchronous application server for Perl compatible with PSGI. Check out our example on how to use it.

=abstract start

If our web application has requests that take a relatively long time process, and if there are several clients connecting at the same time,
they can easily tie up all the process of the web server. Creating more workers is possible, and
as <a href="/concurrent-requests-and-measuring-performance-with-apachebench">our benchmark shows</a> it can provide good performance,
but each such worker is a separate process. They require both memory allocation and processing power.

An alternative is to use an asynchronous web server, such as <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Twiggy">Twiggy</a>,
that can handle a lot of request in a singple process.

Of course we can't just start using Twiggy, for this to work well, we'll also have to rewrite the application.

<h2>Echo using Asynchronous programming</h2>

This is the simple <a href="/how-to-build-a-dynamic-web-application-using-psgi">echo application</a>, with the
2 seconds delay added in <a href="/concurrent-requests-and-measuring-performance-with-apachebench">this version</a>,
rewritten using <a href="/anyevent">AnyEvent</a> to be used with <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Twiggy">Twiggy</a>.

The anonymous subroutine assigned to <hl>$app</hl> will run for every request.
The line <hl>my $request = Plack::Request->new($env);</hl> gets the current request object and then we check
if the <hl>field</hl> parameter has been supplied. If not, we immediately return (after the if-block) with the
simple content returned by the <hl>get_html</hl> function.

<include file="examples/async_echo_delay.psgi">

The interesting part is what happens when the "field" has a true value and we enter the if-block.
In there, we create and return an anonymous function. Once that function is returned, the application
has sort of two directions. On one hand it has finished to handle the current request and it is ready
to handle the next request, on the other hand, it has not sent a response yet and thus the connection
to the client is still alive. In that sense it has not finished to handle the request yet.

The function itself creates an Asynchronous time object that will execute its call-back (supplied a the
value of <hl>cb</hl>, <hl>after 2 seconds</hl>. We don't use <hl>sleep</hl> as in the earlier example,
as that would cause the application to be irresponsive for 2 seconds. Instead we ask AnyEvent
to call our call-back 2 seconds later. The call-back itself will create the 3-element response required
by PSGI.

The variable <hl>$t</hl> holds the timer object. It needs a bit more attention than usual variables.
It has to exists already before the call to the <hl>timer</hl> method, hence we declare it with
<hl>my $t;</hl> in a separate statement, and it has to be destroyed when the timer is finished.
Hence we call <hl>undef $t;</hl> inside the call-back of the timer.


<h2>Running and benchmarking</h2>

Let's save it in a file called <hl>async_echo_delay.psgi</hl>
and run it using <hl>twiggy async_echo_delay.psgi</hl>.

It does not print anything on the console, but we can already access it via http://127.0.0.1:5000/

We can also use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ApacheBench">ApacheBench</a> to measure the response
time of the server as we did in <a href="/concurrent-requests-and-measuring-performance-with-apachebench">this article</a>.

We send 200 request in parallel. The reports that the whole benchmark takes 2.043 seconds, meaning that
using a single process and a single thread, Twiggy was able to handle all the request in parallel.
