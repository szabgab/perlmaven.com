I'm currently using ImageMagick's convert command to convert a png to a
tiff and to remove the transparent background and replace it with white
(this is needed by tesseract ocr):

<code>
convert img.png -background white -alpha off -alpha remove
</code>

I haven't been able to figure out how to remove the alpha channel with Imager.
So far all I have is

<code lang="perl">
$image->write(file => 'output.tiff', i_background => '#ffffff')
</code>

but because tiff supports transparent backgrounds apparently,
the i_background doesn't have an effect. how do i remove the alpha channel
while making the background white?

Create a new image, fill it with white and use rubthrough to compose
the original over the background:

<code lang="perl">
# source in $image
my $back = Imager->new(xsize => $image->getwidth, ysize => $image->getheight);
$back->box(filled => 1, color => "#FFFFFF");
$back->rubthrough(src => $image);
$back->write(file => "output.tiff");
</code>

Thank you, that works great. I did notice, though, that the resulting
TIFF produced by Imager is 3x the size of that produced by convert.

If the input image is greyscale with alpha you can make the output image greyscale instead:

<code lang="perl">
my $back = Imager->new(xsize => $image->getwidth, ysize => $image->getheight,
        channels => $image->getchannels() > 2 ? 3 : 1);
</code>

Assuming your fill colour is monochrome. Also, size will depend on what compression
options you use, Imager defaults to packbits compression for TIFF,
you can override that with <hl>tiff_compression => "lzw"</hl> for example.

How to cut video frame by frame and keep the key frames only on Mac MTS
recordings from AVCHD camcorder are often highly compressed before stored,
such a compressed movie contains key frames and non-key frames. Key frames
can be displayed independently, while non-key frames can not be displayed
without key frames. So such a functionality to locate and display every
frame correctly, no matter key frame or non-key frame, is called frame accuracy
(frame by frame). (Tip: Frame is one of the many single photographic images in a video.)
