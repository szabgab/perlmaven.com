The <b>defined</b> function in Perl checks if the given value is anything but [undef](/undef)


{% include file="examples/defined.pl" %}

<b>defined</b> means it is NOT [undef](/undef)

<b>not defined</b> means it is [undef](/undef)

Being "[false](/false)" or "[true](/true)" have different meaning than being "defined" or "not defined".
