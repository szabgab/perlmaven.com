=abstract start

While Perl does not provide any built-in facilities to declare the parameters of a subroutine,
it makes it very easy to pass any number of parameters to a function.

This makes it almost trivial to write functions such as <hl>sum</hl>.

=abstract end

<include file="examples/variable_parameters.pl">

In this example, first we passed four numbers to the <hl>sum</hl> subroutine, and in the second call
we passed an array that has three numbers in it.

The subroutine itself receives the parameters in the standard <hl>@_</hl> variable.
In this case we do not copy the values to private variables as the functions is really simple.
We just iterate over the values using a <hl>foreach</hl> loop and add each value the <hl>$sum</hl> variable.

The <hl>return</hl> call will, pass the value of <hl>$sum</hl> to the caller.

<h2>Private array</h2>

We could have copied the content of <hl>@_</hl> to a private variable declared within
the subroutine, but it was not necessary in this example.

<code lang="perl">
sub sum {
   my @values = @_;
   ...
</code>


<h2>Passing more than one array</h2>

Unfortunately, if you'd like to pass two arrays to a function like in the following example,
you are in trouble.

<code lang="perl">
my @good = ('Yoda', 'Luke', 'Leia');
my @evil = ('Darth Vader', 'Emperor');
print award(@good, @evil), "\n";
</code>

The subroutine will see all the values ('Yoda', 'Luke', 'Leia', 'Darth Vader', 'Emperor')
in the <hl>@_</hl> array, and there will be no easy way to tell which value
came from the first array, and which from the second.
In order to solve this we'll need to learn about references.
