I encountered <b>Invalid CODE attribute</b> error quite a few times while trying to write examples for <a href="/attribute-handlers">Attribute::Handlers</a>.

=abstract end

In a basic case this would happen if you try to set an attribute on a function that has not been declared.

The obvious case is this, when we have not declared the <b>Wrap</b> attribute in the code:

<include file="examples/attributes/wrap.pl">

However this also happened to me when I was trying to <b>import</b> the attribute from the module where I declared it.
The only solution I found so far is to inherit from the module (e.g. using <b>base</b>) as you can see in the
article about <a href="/attribute-handlers">Attribute::Handlers</a>.
