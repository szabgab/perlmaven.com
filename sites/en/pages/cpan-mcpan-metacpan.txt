=abstract start

Searching for a Perl module on Google will most probably lead you to a page on search.cpan.org, the old front-end of CPAN.
By typing the letter 'm' in front of cpan.org in the URL, you can easily switch to MetaCPAN.


=abstract end

<screencast file="cpan-mcpan-metacpan" youtube="gCczqcZdwvI" />

There you can jump to the latest version of the module or to the distribution containing the module.

This trick was also described in <a href="/jumping-from-search-cpan-org-to-metacpan-org">another article</a>, but now
it comes with a screencast.
