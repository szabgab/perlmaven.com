Exercise number


Write a function that given a string it return true if the string is a number. As there might be several definitions of what is the number create several solutions one for each definition:

* Non negative integer.
* Integer. (Will you also allow + in front of the number or only - ?
* Real number. (Do you allow .3 ? What about 2. ?
* In scientific notation. (something like this: 2.123e4 )
