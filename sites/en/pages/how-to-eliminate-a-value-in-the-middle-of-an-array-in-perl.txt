In response to an earlier article about <a href="/undef-and-defined-in-perl">undef</a> one of the readers asked me:

How do you eliminate a value in the middle of an array in Perl?

I am not sure if <hl>undef</hl> and eliminating values from an array are related, though I guess, if we see having a value of <hl>undef</hl>
as being "empty", then I can understand the connection. In general though, setting something to be <hl>undef</hl> and deleting something is not the same.

=abstract end

Let's see first how we can set an element of an array to be <hl>undef</hl> and then how we can delete an element from an array.

We start with the following code:

<code lang="perl">
use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);
my @dwarfs = qw(Doc Grumpy Happy Sleepy Sneezy Dopey Bashful);
print Dumper \@dwarfs;
</code>

When printed using <hl>Data::Dumper</hl> we get the following output:

<code>
$VAR1 = [
          'Doc',
          'Grumpy',
          'Happy',
          'Sleepy',
          'Sneezy',
          'Dopey',
          'Bashful'
        ];
</code>

<h2>Set an element to undef</h2>

Using the return value of the <hl>undef()</hl> function:

<code lang="perl">
use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);
my @dwarfs = qw(Doc Grumpy Happy Sleepy Sneezy Dopey Bashful);

$dwarfs[3] = undef;

print Dumper \@dwarfs;
</code>

This code will set element 3 (the 4th element of the array) to <hl>undef</hl>, but will <b>NOT</b> change the size of
the array:

<code>
$VAR1 = [
          'Doc',
          'Grumpy',
          'Happy',
          undef,
          'Sneezy',
          'Dopey',
          'Bashful'
        ];
</code>

Using the <hl>undef()</hl> function directly on an element of an array yields similar results:

<code lang="perl">
use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);
my @dwarfs = qw(Doc Grumpy Happy Sleepy Sneezy Dopey Bashful);

undef $dwarfs[3];

print Dumper \@dwarfs;
</code>

So for our purposes <hl>$dwarfs[3] = undef;</hl> and <hl>undef $dwarfs[3];</hl> do the same thing.
They both can set a value to be <hl>undef</hl>.

<h2>Removing an element from the array using splice</h2>

The <hl>splice</hl> function can totally eliminate the value from the array:

<code lang="perl">
use Data::Dumper qw(Dumper);
my @dwarfs = qw(Doc Grumpy Happy Sleepy Sneezy Dopey Bashful);

splice @dwarfs, 3, 1;

print Dumper \@dwarfs;
</code>

<code>
$VAR1 = [
          'Doc',
          'Grumpy',
          'Happy',
          'Sneezy',
          'Dopey',
          'Bashful'
        ];
</code>

As you can see, in this case the array became one element shorter as we have <b>removed one of the elements</b> from the middle of the array.

This is how you can <b>delete an element from an array</b>.
