Neil Bowers is a long time Perl programmer, and has managed all sorts of developers, including Perl ones.

He is also a prolific Perl blogger who writes articles comparing 10-20 Perl modules that are supposed to
do the same task. Offering a step in the direction of CPAN curation.

He is also the joint owner of a small bootstrapped Perl-based start-up company.

<podcast>

* [The blog of Neil Bowers](http://neilb.org/) "running" on his own, not-yet-published static blog engine. ([NEILB on CPAN](https://metacpan.org/author/NEILB).)
* [Neil Bowers on blogs.perl.org](http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/)
* The business Neil runs is called [Cogendo](http://www.cogendo.com/) - It provides a web based service (in the cloud) for companies managing setting objectives,
and doing an appraisal at the end of the year for their employees.
* Neil mentions the [reviews of CPAN modules](http://neilb.org/reviews/) that he writes,
    and specifically mentioned:
    <ul>
* A review of [modules for generating passwords](http://neilb.org/reviews/passwords.html).
* A review of [modules for parsing User-Agent strings](http://neilb.org/reviews/user-agent.html).
    </ul>

* Working with [Olaf Alders](http://www.wundercounter.com/) ([OALDERS](https://metacpan.org/author/OALDERS))
    to produce a single module for parsing user agent strings.
* Neil mentioned [Andy Wardly](http://wardley.org/), [ABW on CPAN](http://metacpan.org/author/ABW), and the [Template Toolkit](http://metacpan.org/module/Template)
* [Philippe Bruhat](http://www.bruhat.net/) ([BooK](http://metacpan.org/author/BOOK)) who is (considering) writing his own static blogging software.
* [Zefram (Andrew Main)](http://www.fysh.org/~zefram/) and [Zefram on CPAN](http://metacpan.org/author/ZEFRAM)
* [Questhub](http://questhub.io/) and its creator [Vyacheslav Matyukhin](http://berekuk.ru/) [BEREKUK](https://metacpan.org/author/MMCLERIC)
* [Yanick Champoux](https://metacpan.org/author/YANICK)'s [proposal](http://techblog.babyl.ca/entry/metacpan-recommendations)
    and [Tim Bunce](http://blog.timbunce.org/)'s [proposal](http://blog.timbunce.org/2013/03/10/suggested-alternatives-as-a-metacpan-feature/) ([TIMB](https://metacpan.org/author/TIMB)) discussing tagging/recommendations on MetaCPAN

<p>
Some of the things Neil talked about:
* Put links to competing / similar / complementary modules in the <b>SEE ALSO</b> section of your module.
* Help other people to solve their problems to get a reputation for being helpful, being a good programmer.
    Helping other people is the best way to make sure you understand the technology.
    Try [Perl on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/perl).
    [Questhub](http://questhub.io) is a good way to encourage people and to offer help and advice, without waiting for someone to ask a specific question.
* Having a clear goal and thinking how to get from here to there. Breaking things down in smaller sized chunks, keep them on a list, or in Questhub.
