=abstract start

<a href="https://metacpan.org/">MetaCPAN</a> has a couple of links at the top. One of them shows the
<a href="https://metacpan.org/recent">recently uploaded distributions</a>. You can use a filter to see
only those that were uploaded for the first time.

This is a great way to see what's is totally new on CPAN?
