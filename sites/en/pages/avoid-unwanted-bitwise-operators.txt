A while ago I saw this in some code:

<code lang="perl">
$x |= some_sub();
</code>

It is syntactically correct but it is almost sure to be a typo.

=abstract end

The recommended way (for lazy programmers) to assign <a href="/how-to-set-default-values-in-perl">default to a scalar variable</a> is

<code lang="perl">
$x ||= some_sub();
</code>


or, if you are using perl 5.10 or newer then the correct way is

<code lang="perl">
$x //= some_sub();
</code>

using the defined-or operator.

Actually I think there are very few applications where bitwise operators are needed.
It might be interesting to see which CPAN modules use them.

When I encountered this issue I started to write an e-mail to the developers
of <a href="/how-to-set-default-values-in-perl">Perl::Critic</a>
asking for their help catching code that uses bitwise operators.
I have not even finished the message when I saw a posting by
<a href="http://petdance.com/">Andy Lester</a> about exactly the same issue.
Except he already implemented a Perl Critic policy to check for this.
Now, after almost two months finally I had time to try it.
I installed <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Bangs">Perl::Critic::Bangs</a>.

Created a file called <hl>code.pl</hl> with the following content:

<code lang="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;

my $x = 3 & 4;
$x |= 42;
</code>

(I use <a href="/strict">strict and warnings</a> even when I write simple examples.)

and ran <b>perlcritic code.pl</b>

This was the result

<code>
Use of bitwise operator at line 12, column 11.  
      Use of bitwise operator "&".  (Severity: 5)
Use of bitwise operator at line 13, column 4.  
      Use of bitwise operator "|".  (Severity: 5)
</code>

Thank you Andy and thank all the developers of the
<a href="http://www.perlcritic.com/">Perl::Critic</a> ecosystem.
