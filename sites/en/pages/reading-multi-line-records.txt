=abstract start

Given a <hl>&lt;rlnrp:cell=all;</hl> (look at the first line of the file)
type data file describing relationships between GSM cells,
we need to flatten the multi-line records. Probably in order to import them into a database.

Such tasks are often required by engineers in telco companies or companies that support them.

<h2 id="output">The expected output data</h2>

If your screen is not wide enough it might be a bit unclear, but in the expected output we have one header line and 4 data lines.
Try to reduce the font-size to see how it should look like. The line numbers on the left can be a clue to the real lines in the expected
output file.

<h2 id="description">A bit of description</h2>

The first few lines, up until the first line with 'CELL' in it can be regarded as garbage for our purposes.

There are several sections starting with 'CELL'.

In each section there are several records starting with 'CELLR'. Each such record spreads several lines.
As I can see in this cases each record has 12 physical line which is split up into 4 logical lines.
Each logical line consist of 3 physical lines: a header, a data and and empty line.

CELL is serving cell and CELLR is neighbouring cell.

The line with the 'END' indicates the end of all the file.
