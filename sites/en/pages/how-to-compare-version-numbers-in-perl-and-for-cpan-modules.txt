Version numbers are very flexible in Perl and unfortunately people have been abusing this freedom.
even though <a href="http://www.dagolden.com/index.php/369/version-numbers-should-be-boring/">Version numbers should be boring</a>.

=abstract end

A couple of examples for version numbers:

<code>
5.010
v5.10
5.010.002

1.10
1.10_02

1.10_TEST
</code>


You might also know that <hl>5.010</hl> is the same as <hl>v5.10</hl> which creates a great deal of confusion to
people who are not aware of this.

There are at least two modules that handle version numbers: <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/version">version</a>
and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Version">Perl::Version</a>, but it seems only the
<a href="/perl-version-number-confusion">former works properly</a>.

So I recomment the <b>version</b> module.

It <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/overload">operator overloading</a> to allow us to use the various numerical
comparision operators such as <hl>&gt;</hl>, <hl>&lt;</hl> and even the spaceship operators <hl>&lt;=&gt;</hl>
to sort a bunch of version numbers.

<include file="examples/version_example.pl">

It seems to be working properly as the following cases show:

<include file="examples/version.pl">

You can also sort version numbers:

<include file="examples/sort_versions.pl">

<h2>Invalid version format</h2>

The module will not properly parse the last example:

<code>
say version->parse('1.23_TEST');
</code>

Will generate an excpetion  saying <b>Invalid version format (misplaced underscore) at ...</b>

<h2>Comments</h2>

Hello Gabor,
I'm sorting versions in my perl script and using the latest v5.10.1 but seeing the following error pop up " contains invalid data; ignoring: ", is this because of the perl version?

---

What is in the string you are parsing that gives you this error message?

---

I'm a newbie at perl in the learning process and i'm trying to sort the versions i'm passing from the @versions array and it gives the error.

---
Please show the actual source code, from this I cannot guess.
