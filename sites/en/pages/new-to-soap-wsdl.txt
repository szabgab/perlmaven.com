Hi All

wsdl2perl.pl worked well for me under Ubuntu karmic
I also succeed nicely in placing a request over https

The place where I am a bit at a loss is how:
1) use the response of the server (aka how to access various
fields in header and body of the soap response

2) how to influence the header of the request, I need to insert a SessionToken
Any pointer to documentation or sample code would be greatly appreciated

Kind Regards

Hey, I did progress!

In this forum there is the <a href="/soap-wsdl-retrieving-output">magic thread</a>

That is enough hints for me to get started getting values out of my responses
Leaving me with the problem of inserting a value into my request header
So I do not close question completely yet Thanks

Hi I did progress again, and solved my issues/questions so far
I will post here a little example based on the Betfair public API,
hopping it will help the next ones wanting to try SOAP::WSDL

follow instruction and have SOAP::WSDL installed on your box.
also install the Crypt::SSLeay package as API is using HTTPS.

then from command line of your box:

<code>
perl wsdl2perl.pl -b ./w2p https://api.betfair.com/global/v3/BFGlobalService.wsdl
</code>

then go into the subdir w2p and run following script

<code lang="perl">
#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use Data::Dumper;
use MyInterfaces::BFGlobalService::BFGlobalService;

my $bfs = MyInterfaces::BFGlobalService::BFGlobalService->new(
     );


print "\n ... going to log in now!\n";
#$bfs->no_dispatch( 1 );
my $sres = $bfs->login( {
     request => {
       username => 'your_betfair_id',
       password => 'your_betfair_pwd',
       productId=> 82
       }
     }
     );
die $sres if not $sres;
print $sres;
print Dumper $sres->as_hash_ref();
print "\n\n\n";

my $obj = $sres->get_Result()->get_errorCode();
print "$obj \n";

my $validUntil = $sres->get_Result()->get_validUntil();
print "$validUntil \n";

my $sesstoken = $sres->get_Result()->get_header()->get_sessionToken();
print "$sesstoken \n";



print "\n ... going to send a keepAlive\n";
# $bfs->no_dispatch( 1 );
my $resp = $bfs->keepAlive (
	{ request => { header => { sessionToken => $sesstoken } } }
    );

die $resp if not $resp;
print $resp;
print Dumper $resp->as_hash_ref();
print "\n\n\n";

print $resp->get_FOO();
</code>

this will give you following output:

This small example should give you some hints about getting return values,
about putting a value in the body or header segment of a soap request.

I did not make the complete use of the power of SOAP::WSDL yet,
but have to say: ... THANK YOU MARTIN! Nice clean job all around.

Hoping this post may help others to find the first leads into this module
Tchao!

Thanks for this example though I tried to retrieve the WSDL file for the Betdaq API also at:

https://api.betdaq.com/v2.0/API.wsdl
using the command:

<code>
wsdl2perl.pl -b ./w2p https://api.betdaq.com/v2.0/API.wsdl
</code>

And it complains horribly with lots of the following:

<code>
Deep recursion on anonymous subroutine at /usr/lib/perl5/Template/Document.pm line 155.
</code>

Failing to build the necessary directory structure. Any ideas?

Hi
As I said in previous email I am a newcomer to Soap::Wsdl
But to get my example working I had to read through the whole forum
And there you find:

That <a href="/soap-wsdl-deep-recursion-warning-while-using-wsdl2perl">looks</a to me as
applying to your case

Good Luck

Posted on 2009-12-21 21:27:38-08 by denman in response to 11997

Thanks for the good pointer - this indeed avoided the recursion issue.
However another issue has become apparent in that not all subdirectories and functions
are created - so only MyTypes and MyInterfaces, not MyElements.
It looks like <a href="/soap-wsdl-deep-recursion-warning-while-using-wsdl2perl">someone else has had</a> this problem though I can't see a reply to it.

Any idea how to get all directories? I'll also cross post to their thread.
Nb: If you are interested in betting exchange APIs, the Betdaq one is also free so you can see the issues for yourself:
