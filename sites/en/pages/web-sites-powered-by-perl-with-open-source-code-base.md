This is a list of web sites that are running on Perl where the source-code is available
as Open Source. If you are looking for a project to contribute to, or just to learn from, these are all excellent choices.

I've tried to group them according to the level of activity of the project and where I could,
I also mentioned the framework used for the project.

There is another, related list of the [Perl based open source products](/perl-based-open-source-products).



## Most actively maintained sites

[Perl Maven](https://perlmaven.com/), the web-site you are looking at now is based on [Dancer 2](/dancer)
and its source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/szabgab/Perl-Maven).

and [cpan-api](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/) is the back-end.

## Second tier

These are sites where the framework is in Perl and it is Open Source, but where the site-specific code is not. Most likely you won't be able to contribute to these sites.

<a href="http://www.krang.net/using-krang.html>These sites</a> are running on [Krang](http://www.krang.net/). Krang itslef is
Open Source, but probably you won't be able to look at the source code of those web sites.

[Everything2](http://everything2.com/), source code in [this repository](https://github.com/everything2/everything2).


[PerlMonks](http://www.perlmonks.org/) is based on a version of Everything. According to  [this node](http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=955375)
a different version of Everything (Everything2) is now open source, but there are some PerlMonks specific things that are not open source.
