This video demonstrates [CPANCover](http://cpancover.com/), the web site that shows tests coverage reports for CPAN modules.
Behind the scenes it uses the [Devel::Cover](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Cover) module to create the individual reports.

You can also use it for your own projects or in your company to check how well is your code tested.
