=abstract start

Lots of Perl programs deal with text files such as configuration files or
log files, so in order to make our knowledge useful it is important at
an early stage to learn about file handling.

Let's first see how can we write to a file, because that seems to be easier.

=abstract end

This article shows how to write to a file using core perl. There are much simpler
and more readable ways to do that
<a href="/use-path-tiny-to-read-and-write-file">using Path::Tiny</a>.

Before you can write to a file you need to <b>open</b> it, asking
the operating system (Windows, Linux, OSX, etc) to open a channel
for your program to "talk to" the file. For this Perl provides
the <hl>open</hl> function with a slightly strange syntax.

<include file="examples/open_file_for_writing.pl">

This is a good working example and we'll get back to it, but let's start with a simpler example:


<h2>Simple example</h2>

<include file="examples/open_file_for_writing_simple.pl">

This still needs some explanation. The <b>open</b> function gets 3 parameters.

The first one, <hl>$fh</hl>, is a scalar variable we just defined inside the <hl>open()</hl> call.
We could have defined it earlier, but usually it is cleaner to do it inside,
even if it looks a bit awkward at first. The second parameter defines the
way we are opening the file.
In this case, this is the the greater-than sign (<hl>&gt;</hl>) that means we are opening
the file for writing.
The third parameter is the path to the file that we would like to open.

When this function is called it puts a special sign into the <hl>$fh</hl> variable.
It is called file-handle. We don't care much about the content of
this variable; we will just use the variable later. Just remember, the content of the file
is still only on the disk and <b>NOT</b> in the $fh variable.

Once the file is open we can use the <hl>$fh</hl> file-handle in a <hl>print()</hl> statement.
It looks almost the same as the <hl>print()</hl> in other parts of the tutorial,
but now the first parameter is the file-handle and there is <b>no</b>(!) comma after it.

The print() call above will print the text in the file.

Then with the next line we close the file handle. Strictly speaking this is not
required in Perl. Perl will automatically and properly close all the
file-handles when the variable goes out of scope, at the latest when the script ends.
In any case, explicitly closing the files can be considered as a good practice.

The last line <hl>print "done\n"</hl> is only there so the next example will be clearer:

<h2>Error handling</h2>

Let's take the above example again and replace the filename with a path does not exist.
For example write:

<code lang="perl">
open(my $fh, '>', 'some_strange_name/report.txt');
</code>

If you run the script now you will get an error message:

<code>
print() on closed file-handle $fh at ...
done
</code>

Actually this is only a warning; the script keeps running and that's why we
see the word "done" printed on the screen.

Furthermore, we only got the warning because we explicitly asked for warnings with
<hl>use warnings</hl> statement.
Try commenting out the <hl>use warnings</hl> and see the script is now silent when it
fails to create the file. So you won't even notice it until the customer, or - even worse -
your boss, complains.

Nevertheless it is a problem. We tried to open a file. We failed but then
still tried to print() something to it.

We'd better check if the <hl>open()</hl> was successful before proceeding.

Luckily the <hl>open()</hl> call itself returns
<a href="/boolean-values-in-perl">TRUE on success and FALSE on failure</a>, so we could write this:

<h2>Open or die</h2>

<code lang="perl">
open(my $fh, '>', 'some_strange_name/report.txt') or die;
</code>

This is the "standard" <b>open or die</b> idiom. Very common in Perl.

<hl>die</hl> is a function call that will throw an exception and
thus exit our script.

"open or die" is a logical expression. As you know from the previous
part of the tutorial, the "or" short-circuits in Perl (as in many other languages).
This means that if the left part is TRUE, we already know the whole expression will
be TRUE, and the right side is not executed. OTOH if the left hand side is FALSE
then the right hand side is also executed and the result of that is the result
of the whole expression.

In this case we use this short-circuit feature to write the expression.

If the <hl>open()</hl> is successful then it returns TRUE and thus the
right part never gets executed. The script goes on to the next line.

If the <hl>open()</hl> fails, then it returns FALSE. Then the right side of the
<hl>or</hl> is also executed. It throws an exception, which exits the script.

In the above code we don't check the actual resulting value of the logical expression.
We don't care. We only used it for the "side effect".

If you try the script with the above change you will get an error message:

<code>
Died at ...
</code>

and will NOT print "done".

<h2>Better error reporting</h2>

Instead of just calling die without a parameter, we could add some explanation of what happened.

<code lang="perl">
open(my $fh, '>', 'some_strange_name/report.txt')
  or die "Could not open file 'some_strange_name/report.txt'";
</code>

will print

<code>
Could not open file 'some_strange_name/report.txt' ...
</code>

It is better, but at some point someone will try to change the path to the correct directory ...

<code lang="perl">
open(my $fh, '>', 'correct_directory_with_typo/report.txt')
  or die "Could not open file 'some_strange_name/report.txt'";
</code>

...but you will still get the old error message because they changed it
only in the open() call, and not in the error message.

<code>
Could not open file 'some_strange_name/report.txt' No such file or directory ...
</code>


It is probably better to use a variable for the filename:

<code lang="perl">
my $filename = 'correct_directory_with_typo/report.txt';
open(my $fh, '>', $filename) or die "Could not open file '$filename'";
</code>

Now we get the correct error message, but we still don't know why it failed.
Going one step further we can use <hl>$!</hl> - a built-in variable of Perl - to print
out what the operating system told us about the failure:

<code lang="perl">
my $filename = 'correct_directory_with_typo/report.txt';
open(my $fh, '>', $filename) or die "Could not open file '$filename' $!";
</code>

This will print

<code>
Could not open file 'correct_directory_with_typo/report.txt' No such file or directory ...
</code>

That's much better.

With this we got back to the original example.

<h2>Greater-than?</h2>

That greater-than sign in the open call might be a bit unclear,
but if you are familiar with command line redirection then this can be familiar to you too.
Otherwise just think about it as an arrow showing the direction of the data-flow:
into the file on the right hand side.

<h2>Non-latin character?</h2>

In case you need to handle characters that are not in the ASCII table, you'll probably want to save them
as UTF-8. To do that you need to tell Perl, you are opening the file with UTF-8 encoding.

<code lang="perl">
open(my $fh, '>:encoding(UTF-8)', $filename)
  or die "Could not open file '$filename'";
</code>
