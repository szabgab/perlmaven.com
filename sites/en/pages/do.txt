<b>do $filename</b> will read the content of the file and the it will try to execute it insides the current process.

I use it sometimes when there is a command line program I'd like to test, but one that needs finer interaction
than one could do if it was executed as an external Perl program. For example if I need to set some variables, or
mock some part of the program.

Just as <b>eval</b> using <b>do<b> will also capture errors it encounters. It is important to understand how we can
see those errors.

Here is how <b>do</b> reports problems.

=abstract end

Basically after calling <b>do $filename;</b>we need to check bot <b>$!</b> and <b>$@</b> and verify that both are empty
as either one of them can contain an error.

Let me show 3 scripts, the first one has no problems:

<include file="examples/do/code_works.pl">

This one has a compile-time error because of a missing <b>my</b> declaration.

<include file="examples/do/compile_time_error.pl">

This one is trying to load a module that does not exist:

<include file="examples/do/code_wrong_use.pl">

The next one can run, but it has a run-time exception:

<include file="examples/do/code_exception.pl">

<h2>Test script to check the cases</h2>

The following is a test script that check the <b>$!</b> and the <$@</b> in the various previous cases and also
in a case where the <b>do $filename;</b> points to a file that does not exist.

<include file="examples/do/test_with_do.t">

You can see that in all of the cases - expect the one with the working code - either <b>$!</b> or <b>$@</b> and sometimes both had some content.
