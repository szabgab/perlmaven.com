=abstract start

If you have a <hl>Makefile.PL</hl>, either because you are using <a href="/makefile-pl-of-extutils-makemaker">ExtUtils::MakeMaker</a>,
or because you are using <a href="/makefile-pl-of-module-install">Module::Install</a> you do the following to created the distribution:

=abstract end

<slidecast file="advanced-perl/libraries-and-modules/packaging-with-makefile-pl" youtube="efUveYthyHw" />

Firs of all you run:
<code>
perl Makefile.PL
</code>

this will check if all the dependencies are installed and if all the files listed in the <hl>MANIFEST</hl> file
were included. Then it will generate the <hl>Makefile</hl> itself without any extension.


Then we run

<code>
make
</code>

part of the "C toolchain". If the module is partially based on C os XS, this will compile the necessary code.
Then it will copy all the necessary Perl files to the <hl>blib/</hl>  directory.  (blib stands for build lib).

Then we run

<code>
make test
</code>

this will run all the unit- and other automated tests.

Then here comes the command that will create the <a href="/manifest-and-manifest-skip">MANIFEST</a> file from
all the files in the development directory excluding the files that have a matching entry in <hl>MANIFEST.SKIP</hl> file.
This command is only needed if you maintain the <hl>MANIFEST.SKIP</hl>. If you maintain the <hl>MANIFEST</hl> file
manually then you would not run this command.

<code>
make manifest
</code>


Then

<code>
make dist
</code>

will take all the files listed in the <hl>MANIFEST</hl> file, copy them to a special directoy
with the name and the version number of the distribution and then create a tarball (a .tar.gz file)
from that directory.

This is the file you'd upload to <a href="http://pause.perl.org/">PAUSE</a> if you wanted to distribute
it via <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, or that's the file you'd distribution
in your in-house CPAN repository, or just send it to your clients and users.


<h2>Installing the module</h2>

When installing the module the first 3 steps are the same:

<code>
Perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
</code>

but then instead of the other 2 steps you'd just run

<code>
make install
</code>

that would install the module in the right place.


On MS Windows, instead of <hl>make</hl> you'd probably have either <hl>dmake</hl> or <hl>nmake</hl> depending the toolchain you have.
