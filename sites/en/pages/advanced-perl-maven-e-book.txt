Reading this <b>Advanced Perl book</b> will teach you how to create modules and classes
and in general how to write and maintain advanced Perl code.

It will teach you how to write Object Oriented code in the modern way, using <b>Moose</b>,
or by using only core Perl: manually blessing references.

While many people use Perl as procedural language with Object Oriented features,
Perl also has capabilities to use it as a functional programming language.
This book will teach you a number of such techniques.

It is based on many years of experience teaching Perl,
blended with the modern features of Perl and CPAN.
