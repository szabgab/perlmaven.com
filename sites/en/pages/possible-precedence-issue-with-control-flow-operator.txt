Recently I've encountered some code hidden in a 1000-line long file that looked like this:

<include file="examples/return_or.pl">

I am not even sure how I noticed it, but it looked incorrect so I created the above simple example.

=abstract end

If we run that script we get:

<code>
1: hello
2: 
</code>

I think the intention was to return the 'default' value if the <hl>$param</hl> is empty, but 
that should be written as:

<code lang="perl">
    return $param || 'default';
</code>

or, if we only want to  <a href="/how-to-set-default-values-in-perl">use the 'default' value</a>
in case <hl>$param</hl> is
<a href="/beginner-perl-maven-undef">undef</a> then, starting from perl 5.10 we should write

<code lang="perl">
    return $param // 'default';
</code>

The problem with using <hl>or</hl> is that its precedence is lower that that of the <hl>return</hl> call.

We can use <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/B::Deparse">B::Deparse</a> to learn what perl really thinks about our code.

Running

<code lang="shell">
perl -MO=Deparse,-p examples/return_or.pl
</code>

We get the following output:

<include file="examples/return_or_deparsed.pl">

Look at line 4. It is of course strange, but basically it means

Return the content of <hl>$param</hl> and if the return call resulted
something <a href="/beginner-perl-maven-true-false">false</a>, then check the content of 'default',
but don't do anything with it.

Not very clever, but that's what perl understands.

<h2>How to locate these issues?</h2>

Now that we know this code is incorrect, we can hopefully go and fix it replacing <hl>or</hl> with <hl>||</hl>,
but given a huge code-base, how can we find all the other places where such code was written?

As you can notice this code-base omitted the <a href="/always-use-strict-and-use-warnings">use warnings</a> statement.

So what happens if we add <hl>use warnings;</hl> ?

Nothing.

We get the same results and no warnings.

We use perl 5.16 in our system and As it turns out this specific issue has not triggered a warning in that version of perl.
Not even in 5.18.2.

The first version I have on my computer that warns about this construct is perl version 5.20.

It says:

<b>Possible precedence issue with control flow operator</b>.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<a href="/always-use-strict-and-use-warnings">Always use warnings</a>, and even if you don't plan to upgrade
to newer version of perl, run your tests there too. At least your compile-test.
They can reveal all kinds of potential bugs.

Also <a href="/testing-for-no-warnings">check for no warnings</a> during the tests. That will help you locate
new warnings that were not around in previous versions of Perl.
