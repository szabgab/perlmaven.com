If you are a **beginner**, or would like to refresh your Perl programming knowledge,
you can go over the [Perl tutorial](/perl-tutorial) or watch the
[Beginner Perl Maven video course](/beginner-perl-maven-video-course).

---

If you need to **maintain a large piece of software** written in Perl by other people in the last 5-10-15 years,
that's a challenge. Especially if you did not get proper training in Perl. You are probably limited to
a specific and old version of Perl. Check out, the [Perl tutorial](/perl-tutorial)!
You can probably skip the part about installing Perl, but the rest of the tutorial will be relevant for you.

---

Perl is often used in **Test Automation**. If you work in this field, or if you'd like to work in this field
(it is much more fun to find bugs in other people's code than in yours :), then you can read the [Perl tutorial](/perl-tutorial)
and the series on [Test Automation using Perl](https://perlmaven.com/testing).

---

If you build **new web applications** - either privately or inside a company - you can start by reading the
article comparing [CGI, mod_perl and PSGI](/perl-cgi-mod-perl-psgi). From there you can go on reading
the generic [Perl tutorial](/perl-tutorial) or the articles on
[Mojolicious](/mojolicious),  [Perl Dancer](/dancer), [Catalyst](/catalyst),
[PSGI/Plack](/psgi), or even [CGI](/cgi), the Common Gateway Interface, for old-school web applications.

In the off chance you are interested in topics other than Perl, especially related to Test Automation, Continuous
Integration, Continuous Deployment, DevOps, then you are welcome to check out the list of
[DevOps related training courses](https://hostlocal.com/).
