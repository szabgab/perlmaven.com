At an online event through the [Perl Maven](https://luma.com/perl-maven) group we tried to understand this module
and even to contriute to it. For more details about the contributions check out the [OSDC Perl](https://osdc.code-maven.com/perl) page.

This example is based on the one in the documentation of the [JSON::Schema::Validate](https://metacpan.org/pod/JSON::Schema::Validate) and tweaked a bit. It will be useful again if we continue dealing with this module.
