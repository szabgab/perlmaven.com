It is often a good idea to have your configuration files or your code contain <b>relative pathes</b> to
various locations as that makes it easy to install your application in different places.

It also makes it a lot  easier to run two totally separate copies of the same program on the same machine.

However, when accessing the files it is often better to use the absolute path-es.

<include file="examples/absolute_path.pl">

<code>
perl examples/absolute_path.pl
</code>
