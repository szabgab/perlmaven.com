=abstract start

<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a> is a system provided by GitHub to automate virtually any process you like.
Including the possibility to create <a href="/ci">Continuous Integration (CI)</a> systems for CPAN distributions.

While Perl developers who upload their code to CPAN will greatly benefit from the volunteers behind <a href="https://www.cpantesters.org/">CPAN Testers</a>
setting up a CI system has a number of benefits even for CPAN developers.

<h2>Why use CI in general?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>A CI system can help you prevent uploading broken releases to CPAN.</li>
    <li>It can give you feedback to the changes you made within minutes after you pushed them out to GitHub.</li>
    <li>It can help verify that a pull-request does not break anything even before you look at it. Indeed the sender of the pull-request will also be able to see if things went wrong and correct them before you spend time on the PR.</li>
    <li>You can configure it to use various services, so for example you can setup a Postgres or MySQL database for the duration of the tests.</li>
    <li>You can store secrets, such as API keys, so the tests can even access APIs that require authentication.</li>
    <li>You can even automate the release to PAUSE, if that's what you'd like to do.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why use GitHub Actions?</h2>

<ul>
    <li>GitHub Actions can run on every push and every pull-request, and there are other triggers as well that you can configure.</li>
    <li>It can run natively on Linux, Windows, or macOS or inside any Docker container, allowing you to verify your code on several operating systems and several different versions of Perl.</li>
    <li>GitHub Actions is free (of charge) for public repositories hosted on GitHub.</li>
    <li>You can find a bunch of <a href="https://code-maven.com/github-actions">sample GitHub Action</a> configurations.</li>
</ul>
