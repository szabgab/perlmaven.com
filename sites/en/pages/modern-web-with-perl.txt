At the beginning of the web, people wrote lots of CGI script. Today, if you would like to write
a modern web application using Perl, you have several options. In this screencast I mention three of them.

<h2>Comments</h2>

I have written a fairly large Perl application. Would it be worthwhile to consider converting to one of these new platforms and, if so, which would be most accommodating to conversion?

I think you'd be better off asking this on Perlmonks where you can have a discussion about it with several people.
