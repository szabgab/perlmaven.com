This warning has disappeared in Perl 5.12, but if you still use an older version of Perl you might encounter it.

=abstract end

The basic code looks like this:

<code lang="perl">
my $x = split /,/, $str;
</code>

The problem is that <hl>split</hl> always returnes a list of values and if you assign it to a scalar value then
at one point perl used to try to guess what you wanted to do.
It would assign the results of the <hl>split</hl> to the <hl>@_</hl> variable <b>implicitly</b> and then use that
in scalar context.
