`undef` is the "unknown value" of Perl. [undef is the initial value of scalar variables](/undef-and-defined-in-perl).


See [undef explained in a video](/beginner-perl-maven-undef) and [how to return nothing (or undef) from a function in Perl?](/how-to-return-undef-from-a-function)

It is also a function that can be used to set variables to be undefined. See [undef on Perl arrays and hashes](/undef-on-perl-arrays-and-hashes).

You can tell apart variables that are <b>undef</b> and that are not by using the [defined](/defined) function.
