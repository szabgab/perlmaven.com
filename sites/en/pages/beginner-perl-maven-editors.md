See also the article about [editors and IDEs](/perl-editor) with some extra comments
and check out the [Perl IDE and Editor Poll, October 2009](http://perlide.org/poll200910/) if you like that kind of stuff.

(Unfortunately since the recording of this video Padre is not developed any more. Its source code was moved to GitHub,
so it will be very easy for you to pick up the pieces and improve it yourself.)
