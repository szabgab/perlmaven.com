The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file">INI file format</a> is a simple file format that allows 2-level configuration options. It was extensively used in MS DOS and MS Windows, and it can be used in lots of places as it is very simple.

<include file="examples/config.ini">

This format consists of section names (in square brackets) and in each section key-value pairs separated by and <hl>=</hl> sign and padded by spaces.

=abstract end

There are several articles showing how to read them using plain Perl for example <a href="/beginner-perl-maven-process-config-file">processing config file</a>
and the exercise <a href="/beginner-perl-maven-exercise-parse-ini-file">parse INI file</a>
however there are several modules on CPAN that would do the work for you in a more generic way.

We'll use <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Config::Tiny">Config::Tiny</a>

<include file="examples/read_config.pl">

The line that reads and parses the configuration file is <hl>Config::Tiny->read</hl>.

It returns a reference to a 2-dimensional hash. The main hash has the sections as keys and the values are the hashes representing each individual section.

We can then access the specific values using the <hl>$config->{section}{key}</hl> construct.

If we use Data::Dumper we can see the whole data structure:

<code>
$VAR1 = bless( {
                 'digital_ocean' => {
                                      'api' => 'seaworld'
                                    },
                 'openweathermap' => {
                                       'api' => 'asdahkaky131'
                                     },
                 'aws' => {
                            'api_code' => 'qkhdkadyday',
                            'api_key' => 'myaws7980'
                          }
               }, 'Config::Tiny' );
</code>

<h2>Write config file</h2>

<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Config::Tiny">Config::Tiny</a> can also write config files
and it can also handle key-value pairs without any section. Check the documentation for details.
