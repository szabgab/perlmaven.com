At a client we have a networked disk with millions of files. I was trying to list the first few files to see what's going on.

<b>ls -l | head</b> takes ages, but here is a Perl one-liner to make it work:

=abstract end

<code>
perl -E 'opendir(my $dh, "/huge_dir"); my $c = 0; while (my $d = readdir($dh)) { say $d; exit if ++$c > 3 }'
</code>

Explanation:

<b>perl -E</b> tells perl that the next string is a piece of perl code that should executed. (as opposed to being a filename) This is what let's us write one-liners in Perl.

<b>opendir(my $dh, "/huge_dir");</b> opens a directory and assigns the directory handle to the new variable called <b>$dh</b> that was declared on the spot with <b>my</b>

<b>my $c = 0;</b> declares a variable called <b>$c</b> and assign 0. We'll use this for  counting the entries.

<b>while (my $d = readdir($dh))</b> a while loop that for each iteration will read one entry from the directory and assign it to the newly declared variable <b>$d</b>.  We declare this variable inside the loop to make it scoped to the loop.

<b>{ say $d; exit if ++$c > 3 }</b> the block of the <b>while loop</b>. First statement prints the value of <b>$d</b> followed by a newline. Then we have a conditional statement in what is called <b>statement modifier</b> where the statement comes before the condition. We first increment the counter and then check if it is greater than 3 and if it is then we call <b>exit</b>.

I was even a bit overdoing with declarations. If we are not using <b>strict</b> we don't need to declare variables. If a variable does not even have value but is incremented using <b>++</b> it will behave as if there was a 0 in it. So we don't need to initialize <b>$c</b>.

<code>
perl -E 'opendir($dh, "/huge_dir"); while ($d = readdir($dh)) { say $d; exit if ++$c > 3}'
</code>


And I don't need that <b>$d</b> variable either. Instead of that I can use the invisible <b>$_</b>:

<code>
perl -E 'opendir($dh, "/huge_dir"); while (readdir($dh)) { say; exit if ++$c > 3}'
</code>
