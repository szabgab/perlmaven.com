When using modules that are not installed in the standard directories
of Perl, we need to change @INC so perl will be able to
find them. There are several ways to do that solving different use-cases.

We are going to see a use-case and a solution, but if you have arrived
to this page, I wonder, do you really have a special case, or do you just need to

<h2>Loading your private Perl module</h2>

You have a script and have just started to move some parts of it,
out to a new module called <hl>My::Module</hl>.
You saved the module to <hl>/home/foobar/code/My/Module.pm</hl>.

Your perl script now starts like this:

<code lang="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;

use My::Module;
</code>

When you run the script you get a friendly error message like this:

<code>
Can't locate My/Module.pm in @INC (@INC contains:
   /home/foobar/perl5/lib/perl5/x86_64-linux-gnu-thread-multi
   /home/foobar/perl5/lib/perl5
   /etc/perl
   /usr/local/lib/perl/5.12.4
   /usr/local/share/perl/5.12.4
   /usr/lib/perl5 /usr/share/perl5
   /usr/lib/perl/5.12
   /usr/share/perl/5.12
   /usr/local/lib/site_perl
   .).
   BEGIN failed--compilation aborted.
</code>

Perl cannot find your module.

<h2>Upgrading a Perl module</h2>

On a system you are thinking to upgrade a module that came from CPAN.
You don't want to install it in the standard location yet. First you'd
like to put it in some private directory, try it, and install
to the system only once you are sure it works well.

In this case too you "install" the module in a private directory,
e.g. in  /home/foobar/code and somehow you'd like to convince
perl to find that version of the module, and not the one that
was installed in the system.

<h2>The use statement</h2>

When perl encounters <hl>use My::Module;</hl> it goes over the
elements of the built-in <hl>@INC</hl> array that contains
directory names. In each directory it checks if there is a
subdirectory called "My" and if in that subdirectory there is
a file called "Module.pm".

The first such file it encounters will be loaded into memory.

If it does not find the file you get the above error messages.

<hl>@INC</hl> is defined when perl is compiled and it
is embedded in the binary code. You cannot change that,
unless you recompile perl. Not something we would do every day.

Luckily the <hl>@INC</hl> array can be changed in several
ways when we execute a script. We'll see these solutions
and discuss when each one of them is appropriate to use.

<h2>PERLLIB and PERL5LIB</h2>

You can define the PERL5LIB environment variable
(though PERLLIB works the same way, I'd recommend using PERL5LIB
over PERLLIB as that makes it clear it is related to Perl 5)
the same way you can define the PATH environment variable.
Every directory listed in this variable will be added to
the beginning of <hl>@INC</hl>.

On <b>Linux/Unix</b> when using <b>Bash</b>, you would write

<code>
export PERL5LIB=/home/foobar/code
</code>

You can add this to the ~/.bashrc to make it always available when
you log-in.

On <b>Windows</b> you can set the same in the cmd command window by typing

<code>
set PERL5LIB=c:\path\to\dir
</code>

For a more long term solution follow these steps:

Right-click <b>My Computer</b> and click <b>Properties</b>.

In the <b>System Properties</b> window, click on the <b>Advanced</b> tab.

In the Advanced section, click the <b>Environment Variables</b> button.

In the Environment Variables window in the "User variables for Foo Bar"
section click on <b>New</b> and type in the following:

Variable name: PERL5LIB

Variable value: c:\path\to\dir

Then click OK 3 times. Windows that you open <b>after</b> this will already know
about the new variable. Type this in the command window, to see the newly set value:

<code>
echo %PERL5LIB%
</code>

<hr>

This will add the private /home/foobar/code directory (or c:\path\to\dir directory)
to the beginning of <hl>@INC</hl> for <b>every script</b> that is executed in
the same environment.

In <b>taint mode</b>, that will be explained in a separate post,
the PERLLIB and PERL5LIB environment variables are ignored.

<h2>use lib</h2>

Adding a <hl>use lib</hl> statement to the script will add
the directory to <hl>@INC</hl> for that specific script.
Regardless who and in what environment runs it.

You just have to make sure to have the use lib statement
before trying to load the module:

<code lang="perl">
use lib '/home/foobar/code';
use My::Module;
</code>

One note here. I saw several companies where <hl>use lib</hl>
statements were added to the modules so they will be able to load
their dependencies. I don't think this is good.
I think the right place to change <hl>@INC</hl> is the main
script or even better, outside the script such as in the two other
solutions.

<h2>-I on the command line</h2>

(That's a capital i)

The last solution is the most temporary solution.
Add a <hl>-I /home/foobar/code</hl> flag to perl
when running the script.

<b>perl -I /home/foobar/code  script.pl</b>

This will add /home/foobar/code to the beginning of
@INC <b>for this specific execution</b> of the script.

<h2>So which one to use?</h2>

If you would like to just test a newer version of a module, I'd recommend the command line flag:
<hl>perl -I /path/to/lib</hl>.

If you are installing lots of modules in a private directory then I'd probably use <hl>PERL5LIB</hl>
though we'll also see <hl>local::lib</hl> that does this for you.

<hl>use lib</hl> is used in two cases:

<ol>
<li>When you have a fixed, but not standard company-wide environment
in which you put modules in a common standard location.</li>
<li>When you are developing an application and you'd like to make sure
the script always picks up the modules relative to their own location.
We'll discuss this in another post.</li>
</ol>
