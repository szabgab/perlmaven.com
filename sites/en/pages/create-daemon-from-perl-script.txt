It is quite easy to turn a perl script into a daemon on Linux that you can manage with systemctl.

=abstract end


<h2>Original script</h2>

<include file="examples/daemon/original.pl">

This is a very simple script that has an infinite loop writing to a log file every second.
If you press Ctr-C then the script will capture that signal (the INT signal), set the <b>$continue</b> flag to 0
and the loop will stop and then the program as well. This is a graceful termination of the process.

How can we convert this something that we can run as a service?

<h2>HUP and TERM instead of INT</h2>

Instead of expecting an INT signal which is sent when your press Ctrl-C while starting at a ru8nning process
we are expecting two other signals. the <b>TERM</b> signal will be received when we try to "<b>stop</b>" the service and when we try to "<b>restart</b>" it.

The <b>HUP</b> is received when we try to "<b>reload</b>" the service. Most service would re-read their configuration file when they are reloaded.
We'll do that too.



The application:

<include file="examples/daemon/local.pl">

The code to create the dameon is the following, using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Daemon::Control">Daemon::Control</a>

<include file="examples/daemon/daemon.pl">

This version is assumed to be located in the same directory as the script itself.

<code>
$ perl daemon.pl
Syntax: daemon.pl [start|stop|restart|reload|status|foreground|show_warnings|get_init_file|help]
</code>

Starting the process:

<code>
$ perl daemon.pl start
</code>

You can chenge the content of "config.txt" while the service is running and then execute

<code>
$ perl daemon.pl reload
</code>

It will re-read the configuration file and continue running.

<include file="examples/daemon/local_process.log">

Stopping the process:

<code>
$ perl daemon.pl stop
</code>
