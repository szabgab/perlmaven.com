The last couple of days I've spent re-building <a href="/dwimperl">DWIM Perl for Linux</a> using a cpanfile, carton,
running builds on Travis-CI and on a <a href="/digitalocean">Digital Ocean Droplet</a>.
<a href="/dwimperl">DWIM Perl for Linux</a> is a <b>batteries included</b> binary distribution of
<b>standard perl + lots of CPAN modules</b>. The hope that it will make
it extremely easy for people to get started using Perl. Without the need to encounter the installation headaches that might come with cpan.

=abstract end

I have plenty of things to write about each one of the subjects, but I've encountered an issue that I am not sure how to solve.
I wanted to install <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Differences">Test::Differences</a> (as a prerequisite of a a lot of things).
It uses <hl>$Config{perlpath}</hl> instead of more common <hl>$^X</hl> to run some external perl scripts from some of the test files.
This blows up during build with <hl>Can't exec "/home/dwimperl/dwimperl-linux-5.20.1-1-x86_64/perl/bin/perl": No such file or directory</hl>.

Apparently there is a subtle difference between <hl>$Config{perlpath}</hl> and <hl>$^X</hl>. It was mentioned in an answer to
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=1098270">this question</a> as well, but back then I did not understand the issue.
The thing is that in my case <hl>$^X</hl> contains the actual path to the perl executable where it is located when the script is running,
while <hl>$Config{perlpath}</hl> contains the path to the perl executable when it was compiled.

I compiled and originally installed this perl to the <b>/home/dwimperl/dwimperl-linux-5.20.1-1-x86_64/perl/</b> directory, but when
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a> uses it, it is placed to <b>/home/travis/dwimperl-linux-5.20.1-4-x86_64/perl/</b>.

<h2>Changing the test</h2>

One solution would be to send a patch to the maintainers of <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Differences">Test::Differences</a>
to use <hl>$^X</hl> instead of <hl>$Config{perlpath}</hl>, but I am not sure they'd accept, I don't know if this would be right to do,
and most importantly, this would only solve this specific case. Surely there are going to be other modules using <hl>$Config{perlpath}</hl>
and they'd be broken as well. Even the real users of <a href="/dwimperl">DWIM Perl for Linux</a> might us that value
and the system will be broken for them.

<h2>Skip the test</h2>

Another solution would be to install Test::Differences using the <hl>--notest</hl> flag of <hl>cpanm</hl>.
This solution would be quicker (no need to wait for the maintainers of Test::Differences), and no need to depend on them, whether
they accept the change or not.
On the other hand this would not solve any of my other concerns. This could be a work-around till I find a better solution.

<h2>Change $Config{perlpath}</h2>

DWIM Perl is supposed to be relocatable. It was compiled with the <hl>userelocatableinc</hl> flag which means it automatically
adjusts the content of <hl>@INC</hl> to the location of perl. That part worked well. I wonder if there is some other flag
I need to use to compile perl to make it adjust <hl>perlpath</hl> and maybe even some other variables?

Running <hl>perl -MData::Dumper -MConfig -e'print Dumper \%Config'</hl> shows quite a few variables that contains the full path to where
this perl was first installed. There are quite a few that show the new path but these variables include the old one, that does not
exists any more:

<code>
config_arg3
config_args
initialinstalllocation
installbin
installprefix
perlpath
startperl
</code>


As I can see <a href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2014-01/msg00003.html">this thread</a> on the Perl 5 Porters
list was about a solution for this problem.

I posted this question on <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=1102042">Perl Monks</a> as well.
