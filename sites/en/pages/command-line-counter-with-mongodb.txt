In the <a href="https://code-maven.com/counter">counter</a> examples we have already seen command line solutions, but we have not used
MongoDB as the back-end storage.
There is a <a href="http://code-maven.com/counter-in-mongodb-client">counter with MongoDB client</a>
and we are using the solution from there, but from Perl.

=abstract end

<include file="examples/counter_mongodb.pl">

We assume MongoDB 1.0.1 (Version 1 introduces some changes so if you have an older version of the client this might not work.)

After connecting to the database server on localhost, accessing a <hl>database</hl> called 'test', we fetch an object to access the
<hl>collection</hl> called 'counter'. As usual, we don't need to create any of these. The first time we insert any value,
they will both spring to existance.

Then we call the <hl>find_one_and_update</hl> method.
The first hash is the locator. It will find the document where the <hl>_id</hl> is the name we gave on the command line.
The name of the counter.

The second hash is the actual update command. Here we say we would like to increment (<hl>$inc</hl>) the field 'val' by 1.

The third hash provides some additional parameters for runnin our request. <hl>upsert</hl> means we would like to <hl>update</hl>
the document if it could be found, and <hl>insert</hl> it if could not be found. The <hl>new</hl> field means we would like
the call to return the document <b>after</b> the update. (By default it would return the old version of the document.)
See also the documentation of <a href="http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/method/db.collection.findAndModify/">findAndModify</a>
for more options.

<code lang="perl">
my $res = $col->find_one_and_update(
    { _id => $name },
    {'$inc' => { val => 1}},
    {'upsert' => 1, new => 1},
);
