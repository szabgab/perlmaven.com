On this site we cover a lot of different topic related programming in Perl.
We also have another site called [Code Maven](https://code-maven.com/) where we cover every tech-related topic other than Perl.


On the [front page](/) you can find the list of all the series we have.


Some of our content is only [available to paying subscribers](https://code-maven.com/archive?tag=pro), but some of those
are always available to [preview](https://code-maven.com/archive?tag=preview).
You only need to [register](/pm/register) on the site to get access to the videos in preview mode.

If you are not interested registering here you can get updates from us via our [Code Maven LinkedIn page](https://code-maven.com/linkedin)
or the [Perl Maven page](https://linkedin.com/showcase/perl-maven/).

You'll get tips and examples 3-5 times a week.

You can also follow out [YouTube channel](/youtube) where we have a mix of technical videos and webinar recordings.
