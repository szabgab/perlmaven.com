Perl does not have a special boolean type and yet,
in the documentation of Perl you can often see that a function returns a "Boolean" value.
Sometimes the documentation says the function returns true or returns false.

So what's the truth?

=abstract end


Perl does not have specific boolean type, but every scalar value - if checked using <b>if</b>
will be either true or false. So you can write

<code lang="perl">
if ($x eq "foo") {
}
</code>

and you can also write

<code lang="perl">
if ($x) {
}
</code>

the former will check if the content of the <b>$x</b> variable is the same as the "foo"
string while the latter will check if $x itself is true or not.

<h2>What values are true and false in Perl?</h2>

It is quite easy. Let me quote the documentation:

<pre>
The number 0, the strings '0' and '', the empty list "()", and "undef"
are all false in a boolean context. All other values are true.
Negation of a true value by "!" or "not" returns a special false
value. When evaluated as a string it is treated as '', but as a number, it is treated as 0.

From perlsyn under "Truth and Falsehood".
</pre>

So the following scalar values are considered false:

<ul>
   <li>undef - the undefined value</li>
   <li>0  the number 0, even if you write it as 000  or 0.0</li>
   <li>''   the empty string.</li>
   <li>'0'  the string that contains a single 0 digit.</li>
</ul>

All other scalar values, including the following are true:

<ul>
  <li>1 any non-0 number</li>
  <li>' '   the string with a space in it</li>
  <li>'00'   two or more 0 characters in a string</li>
  <li>"0\n"  a 0 followed by a newline</li>
  <li>'true'</li>
  <li>'false'   yes, even the string 'false' evaluates to true.</li>
</ul>

I think this is because <a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/">Larry Wall</a>,
creator of Perl, has a general positive world-view.
He probably thinks there are very few bad and false things in the world.
Most of the things are true.
