A while ago I wrote an article on <a href="/lwp-useragent-and-basic-authentication">LWP::UserAgent and Basic Authentication</a> and posted it on
Reddit as well, where a user pointed to an even simpler solution, one that I did not find in the documentation myself.
It uses <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent">LWP::UserAgent</a> and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Request::Common">HTTP::Request::Common</a>
which is a dependency of LWP::UserAgent anyway.

(Actually, I think I saw and used this or a similar solution a few years ago, but I did not remember or could not find it again when I wrote the previous article.
Now I seem to recall there was an issue with this solution when the request redirected to another URL that requred Basic Authentication,
but I am not entirly sure. The point is that I think this solution works in most of the cases, but in the rare special cases you might still
need the <a href="/lwp-useragent-and-basic-authentication">other solution</a>.)
