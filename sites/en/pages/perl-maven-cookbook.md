In the future, the <b>Perl Maven Cookbook</b> will have hundreds
of examples with explanation on how to accomplish various tasks.

In the future, it will probably cost around $40 to get an electronic
version of this cookbook.

In the meantime we are in the process of building it and you can get
a copy free-of charge. More than that. You can actually help building
it by sending ideas and comments on the existing examples.

The current edition has the following examples:

* Create Linux/Unix user account - a wrapper around adduser
* Reporting file system diskspace usage like df
* Reporting diskspace usage on a mail server
* A du like script
* Send files by e-mail
* Read Excel file
* Process file with fixed width records
* Process file with multi-line records
* Process multi field csv file
* Fetch web page
* Generate web page  (CGI)
* Parse XML file
* Database access using DBI and DBD::SQLite
* Accessing and LDAP server using Net::LDAP
* Tie::File

Added to 0.02

* How to read a CSV file using Perl? (Added in 0.02)
* How to create an Excel file with Perl  (added in 0.02)
* Reading from LDAP in Perl using Net::LDAP (added in 0.02)

<i>
Just wanted to say thanks for the cookbook. It looks like a great start on a very useful resource indeed.
There are a couple of recipes in there that I can see immediate use for in some stuff I'm doing right now.</i>
