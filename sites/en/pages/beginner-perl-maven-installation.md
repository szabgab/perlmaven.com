Welcome to the [Beginner Perl Maven course](/beginner-perl-maven-video-course).

Let's see how to install Perl on Windows. This still shows the "Padre on Strawberry Perl" package even
though it was already superseded by DWIM Perl for Windows. Today my recommendation is that you install
[Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/)



<slidecast file="beginner-perl/installation" youtube="dskYFZax1Qo" />

* [ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com/)
* [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/)
* [Padre, the Perl IDE](http://padre.perlide.org/)

This video is part of the [Beginner Perl Maven course](/beginner-perl-maven-video-course).
It was recorded a while ago and it has some noise in the background. I am sorry for that. At one point
I am probably going to record a new version of the whole series. Without the noise.
