This is a list of web sites that are running on Perl where the source-code is available
as Open Source. If you are looking for a project to contribute to, or just to learn from, these are all excellent choices.

I've tried to group them according to the level of activity of the project and where I could,
I also mentioned the framework used for the project.

There is another, related list of the <a href="/perl-based-open-source-products">Perl based open source products</a>.
