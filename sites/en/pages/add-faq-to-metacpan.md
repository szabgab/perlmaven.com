When you visit [Meta CPAN](https://metacpan.org/) some of the modules will have a banner saying something like:

<quote>
Take me over?
The maintainer of this distribution is looking for someone to take over! If you're interested then please contact them via email.
</quote>

What does this mean? How to take over a module? How to get rid of this banner?

None of this seem to be explained in the [FAQ of MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/about/faq).
Let's see how can we add this entry to MetaCPAN and how can we change
the banner to link to that entry in the FAQ.
