In the <a href="/beginner-perl-maven-video-course">Beginner Perl Maven video course</a> we will mostly write Perl that are
saved in files, but Perl can also be used on the command line, without saving the code in a file.

We are going to see an example here, and later on we are going to see a couple of more examples.

<slidecast file="beginner-perl/command-line" youtube="cjKol7gTlkA" />

In order to open the command line, on Windows you need to click on <b>Start/Run</b> and then type in <hl>cmd</hl>.

<code>
$ perl -v
</code>

<code>
$ perl -V
</code>

<code>
$ perl -e "print 42"
</code>


If running on perl 5.10 or later, you can also:

<code>
$ perl -E "say 42"
</code>


On Unix/Linux you might prefer to use single quotes <hl>'</hl> around the code:

<code>
$ perl -E 'say 42'
</code>
