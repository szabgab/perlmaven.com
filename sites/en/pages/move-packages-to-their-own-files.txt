After fixing the <a href="/use-strict-use-warnings-no-diagnostics">use strict; use warnings;</a> we can go back to using Perl::Critic.
I ran <hl>perlcritic lib/Pod</hl> that provides some issues to be fixed.

=abstract end

<h2>perlcritic</h2>

The output of <hl>perlcritic lib/Pod</hl> looked like this:

<h2>Package declaration must match filename</h2>

This is usually happens when we have  more than one <hl>package</hl> statements in a file. It works, but usually it is a lot more <b>readable</b>
if every <hl>package</hl> is in its own file.

I've moved the content of <hl>package Pod::Tree::BitBucket;</hl> to the <hl>lib/Pod/Tree/BitBucket.pm</hl> and
the content of <hl>package Pod::Tree::StrStream;</hl> was moved to <hl>lib/Pod/Tree/StrStream.pm</hl>.
In both cases I already had <hl>use strict;</hl> and <hl>use warnings;</hl> in the package. That's what
I did in the <a href="/use-strict-use-warnings-no-diagnostics">earlier</a>, but I still had to add
<hl>1;</hl> at the end of the files to let it <a href="/how-to-create-a-perl-module-for-code-reuse">return true</a>.

Instead of those I put a
<hl>use Pod::Tree::BitBucket;</hl> and <hl>use Pod::Tree::StrStream;</hl> statements in the lib/Pod/Tree/HTML.pm

<a href="https://github.com/szabgab/Pod-Tree/commit/c1fd646f731b7f78a9ff91bedf32d842d90f9c26">commit</a>

The next step was to do the same and factoring out the <hl>package Pod::Tree::Stream;</hl> from <hl>lib/Pod/Tree.pm</hl>
to <hl>lib/Pod/Tree/Stream.pm</hl> replacing it with a <hl>use Pod::Tree::Stream;</hl> statement.

<a href="https://github.com/szabgab/Pod-Tree/commit/fe47cb47f48af612ee88d25d89d3b736ef1a36f9">commit</a>

Then there was the separation of <hl>package Pod::Tree::HTML::PerlTop;</hl> as well.

<a href="https://github.com/szabgab/Pod-Tree/commit/d2747ddae5861610a834631a81bda7804e4f4ee2">commit</a>.

After each such step, before committing the changes I've ran the tests and after committing the changes
and pushing them out to GitHub, it has also triggered Travis-CI to build and test the code.

This, along with the decent test coverage provides me the necessary confidence to make bold changes and move forward.

<h2>perlcritic again</h2>

I ran <hl>perlcritic lib/Pod</hl> again. This time the output was much smaller:

<code>

We can go forward making changes, but I think it is also a good idea to make use of the <a href="http://cpantesters.org/">CPAN Testers</a>.

So I've release version 1.21.
