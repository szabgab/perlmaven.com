=abstract start

This is the list of <b>all</b> the Perl-based open source products I am aware of.

Especially if we focus on products serving the generic public.
Not just other Perl developers.

=abstract end

Thanks to all the people, but especially to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/deanhamstead">Dean Hamstead</a> and
<a href="http://www.perl-services.de/">Renee Baecker</a>, who sent me tons of links.

I tried to check which one of these products allow people to make money from them. How do the web-site of the open-source
project promote the businesses. I'd be very interested to know which projects are actually supported by their
commercial backers, and how do they feel about each other?

Are they run by a single company? Is there a commercial interest behind the project shared by several individuals or
companies? Is the project purely fun-based?
