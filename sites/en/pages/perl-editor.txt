Perl scripts or Perl programs are just simple text files.
You can use any kind of text editor to create them, but you should
not use any word processor. Let me suggest a couple of editors and IDEs.

BTW this article is part of the <a href="/perl-tutorial">Perl tutorial</a>.

=abstract end

You can also watch the video about <a href="/beginner-perl-maven-editors">editors and IDEs</a>.

<h2>Editor or IDE?</h2>

For Perl development you can either use a plain text editor or an
<b>Integrated Development Environment</b>, also called IDE.

First I'll describe the editors on the major platforms you might use,
and then the IDEs which are usually platform independent.

<h2>Unix / Linux</h2>

Here, the most modern, sophisticated editor is clearly <li><a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">UltraEdit</a>.
It is an easy-to-use, (low-cost) commercial editor, with an exceptional array of features (including
macros, scripts, Unicode support, FTP for remote editing, 10 clipboards, and - under Edit/Preferences -
a wide range of configuration options, etc, etc).</li>

At a basic level, if you are working on Linux or Unix, then the most common editors used there are
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>.
They have very different philosophy, both from
each other, and from most of the editors out there.
Although powerful in some ways, their user interface designs are (regretably) many years behind the times,
and hence take a long time to master.

For each one of them there are special extensions or modes to provide better support for Perl,
but even without those they are very good for Perl development.

If you are not familiar with these two editors, then I'd recommend UltraEdit, or failing that,
you separate your Perl learning curve from your editor learning experience.

It is probably better to focus on your Perl studies now, and only later to learn one
of these latter two editors.

While they are native to Unix/Linux, both
<b>Emacs</b> and <b>Vim</b> are available for all the other major operating systems.

<h2>Perl editors for Windows</h2>

On Windows, many people are using the so-called "programmer's editors".

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ultraedit.com/">UltraEdit</a> is a surprisingly cheap (given its feature list)
commercial editor. Some more details are listed under Unix / Linux above.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.textpad.com/">TextPad</a> is share-ware.</li>
<li><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is an open source and free editor.</li>
</ul>

I have been using <b>Notepad++</b> a lot and I keep it installed on my Windows machine
as it can be very useful.

<h2>Mac OSX</h2>

I don't have a Mac but according to popular vote,
<a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> is the most often used Mac
specific editor for Perl development.

<h2>Perl IDEs</h2>

Neither of the above are IDEs, that is, neither of them provide
real, built-in debugger for Perl. They also don't provide language specific help.

<a href="http://www.activestate.com/">Komodo</a> from ActiveState costs a few hundreds of USD.
It has a free version with limited capabilities.

People who are already <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> users might want to know
that there is a Perl plug-in for Eclipse called EPIC. There is also a project called
<a href="https://github.com/skorg/perlipse">Perlipse</a>.

<h2>Padre, the Perl IDE</h2>

In July 2008 I started to write an <b>IDE for Perl in Perl</b>. I called it Padre -
Perl Application Development and Refactoring Environment or
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/">Padre, the Perl IDE</a>.

Many people joined the project. It is distributed by the major Linux distributions
and it can also be installed from CPAN. See the
<a href="http://padre.perlide.org/download.html">download</a> page for details.

In some aspects it is still not as strong as Eclipse or Komodo but in some other,
Perl specific areas it is already better than the other two.

Moreover, it is very actively developed.
If you are looking for a <b>Perl editor</b> or a <b>Perl IDE</b>,
I'd recommend to give it a try.

<h2>The big Perl editor poll</h2>

In October 2009 I ran a poll and asked
<a href="http://perlide.org/poll200910/">Which editor(s) or IDE(s) are you using for Perl development?</a>

Now you can go with the crowd, against the crowd, or you can pick a perl editor that fits you.

<h2>Other</h2>

Alex Shatlovsky recommended <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, which is a platform independent editor,
but one that costs some money.

Then next part in the tutorial is a small side-step to talk about <a href="/perl-on-the-command-line">Perl on the command line</a>.
