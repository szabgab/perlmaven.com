[search.cpan.org](http://search.cpan.org/) is  the older interface to everything on CPAN. In this screencast we go over some of the features
of the web site, specifically the list of authors, the recent page, the FAQ and the Feedback page.

This screencast serves both as a tool to help you get the most out of search.cpan.org and as a tool to create a
[specification for the search.cpan.org cloning](/search-cpan-org) project.

For the textual description of this screencast and the specification check out the [main sco cloning page](/search-cpan-org).

To follow the development of the cloning project, you can look at [GitHub repository](https://github.com/szabgab/MetaCPAN-SCO), but if you'd also like to get detailed
explanation of each step, then subscribe to the [Perl Maven Pro](/pro).

The list of Perl Maven Pro articles dealing with this project can be found at the bottom of the [specification](/search-cpan-org).
