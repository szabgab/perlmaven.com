Dwimperl was a Perl distribution that included a lot of pre-compile CPAN modules. As the project has not been maintained for a long period of
time its website was disabled.

Instead of that I suggest:


## MS Windows

[Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/)

## Linux

The Perl that comes with the Operating System.

<!--
## Apple Mac OSX
-->

## DWIM Perl

If you'd really like to find DWIM Perl you can do so on GitHub:


You can find the [source of the website](https://github.com/dwimperl/dwimperl.com) and in general
the [sources of the project](https://github.com/dwimperl) on GitHub.

Feel free to reuse them as you find that fit.
