Debugging with the built-in command line debugger, with [Devel::ptkdb](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::ptkdb),
or with `print` statements.


<slidecast file="beginner-perl/debugging" youtube="MxwB63zFglo" />

See the full [article about debugging Perl scripts](/debugging-perl-scripts)

An alternative screencast where you can actually see a [live debugging session](/using-the-built-in-debugger-of-perl).

[Devel::hdb is another debugger](/debugging-perl-with-hdb) you could give a try.
