There is no special [boolean values](/boolean-values-in-perl) in Perl that would mean **false** or **true**.
There are certain values that evaluate to [false](/false) or true in boolean context.


See the explanation about [false](/false) and [boolean values](/boolean-values-in-perl) and boolean context.

See also "[defined](/defined)" and "[undef](/undef)" that have different meaning in Perl.
