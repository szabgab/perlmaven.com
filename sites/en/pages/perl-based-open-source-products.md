This is the list of **all** the Perl-based open source products I am aware of.

Especially if we focus on products serving the generic public.
Not just other Perl developers.


Thanks to all the people, but especially to [Dean Hamstead](http://www.linkedin.com/in/deanhamstead) and
[Renee Baecker](http://www.perl-services.de/), who sent me tons of links.

I tried to check which one of these products allow people to make money from them. How do the web-site of the open-source
project promote the businesses. I'd be very interested to know which projects are actually supported by their
commercial backers, and how do they feel about each other?

Are they run by a single company? Is there a commercial interest behind the project shared by several individuals or
companies? Is the project purely fun-based?

## CMS / Publishing systems / Blog engines / wikis

This is a mix of platforms. Some stared out as Content Management Systems (CMS) others as wikis, yet others as blog
engines. In the end there is a huge overlap between what they do so I put them in one category.

<div class="perl-product">

[Movable Type](http://movabletype.org/) is a publishing platform, though I think it is mostly known
as a blog engine. It is backed by the company called [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) that provides a
[hosted version of Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.com/).
[blogs.perl.org](http://blogs.perl.org/) is running Movable Type</a>.
It is sopped being an open source product. The latest Open source release was 5.2.9.

services. This looks like a living ecosystem of open-source and business.

now let me list them here:

<div class="perl-product">
[Social Text](http://www.socialtext.com/). It has hosted version at [Social Text.net](http://www.socialtext.net/).
[The Perl Foundation wiki](https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/) is running on it.
</div>

</div>

<div class="perl-product">
[Live Journal](http://www.livejournal.com/) a shared blogging community system.

## Comments

Thanks for putting this list together Gabor. We need more advocacy of what great software has been written in Perl so we can support it and build a more cohesive community.

If you do any work on the command line, then you really need to install ack. I just found it myself a few weeks ago and it's a fantastic search tool. Not only is it fast, it returns the results in a highly readable format and allows you to customize it however you like. I hadn't heard about it before, so I think this is a real gem that needs to be promoted more.

Useful list there Gabor!

Not open source, but another Perl application to add to your separate list is MIDAS (a room booking system) https://mid.as/
