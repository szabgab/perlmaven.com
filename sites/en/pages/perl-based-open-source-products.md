This is the list of **all** the Perl-based open source products I am aware of.

Especially if we focus on products serving the generic public.
Not just other Perl developers.


Thanks to all the people, but especially to [Dean Hamstead](http://www.linkedin.com/in/deanhamstead) and
[Renee Baecker](http://www.perl-services.de/), who sent me tons of links.

I tried to check which one of these products allow people to make money from them. How do the web-site of the open-source project promote the businesses. I'd be very interested to know which projects are actually supported by their commercial backers, and how do they feel about each other?

Are they run by a single company? Is there a commercial interest behind the project shared by several individuals or companies? Is the project purely fun-based?

## CMS / Publishing systems / Blog engines / wikis

This is a mix of platforms. Some stared out as Content Management Systems (CMS) others as wikis, yet others as blog engines. In the end there is a huge overlap between what they do so I put them in one category.

<img src="/img/mt-nut.jpg" alt="Movable Type logo" style="float:right"  width="120" height="120" />

[Movable Type](http://movabletype.org/) is a publishing platform, though I think it is mostly known
as a blog engine. It is backed by the company called [Six Apart](http://www.sixapart.com/) that provides a
[hosted version of Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.com/). [blogs.perl.org](http://blogs.perl.org/) is running Movable Type. It is sopped being an open source product. The latest Open source release was 5.2.9.



[WebGUI](http://webgui.org/) is a content management system (CMS) created by
[Plain Black](http://plainblack.com/).  It is a very business oriented CMS. On the web site, you can find
a number of [partners](http://www.webgui.org/partners) that provide commercial support and customization
services. This looks like a living ecosystem of open-source and business.

<img src="/img/T-logo-140x40-t.gif" alt="Twiki logo" style="float:right" />

[Twiki](http://twiki.org/) is one of the best-known wiki software with an orientation to support
companies. It is built primarily by the company with the same name that also provides
[cloud-based hosted Twiki service](http://twiki.net/).

a very prominent place.

<img src="/img/foswiki-logo.gif" alt="Foswiki badge" style="float:right"  />

It then generates pages that can be either static or even use some other language to be dynamic.
([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricolage_(software)))

<img src="/img/krang_logo.gif" alt="Krang logo" style="float:right" />

[Krang CMS](http://www.krangcms.com/) Open Source web publisher. It is used by several web-sites but as I can see development
is not too active.

[Blosxom](http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/) is a simple blog engine generating static pages.
<!--
Unfortunately it seems it has not been maintained for a while. Some of the links on the site don't work any more.
Last time I checked, the [Blosxom](http://www.blosxom.com/) site was down.
-->
For more information also check out the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blosxom) page of Blosxom.
There is also a [new community site for Blosxom](http://muli.cc/).

was discontinued by Mozilla.

It even has its own [Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majordomo_%28software%29).

## Desktop Applications

<img src="/img/shutter_logo.png" alt="Shutter logo" style="float:right" />

There are [several companies support Koha](http://koha-community.org/support/paid-support/).
One of them is called [LibLime](http://www.liblime.com/).

Apparently this company actually has a [fork of Koha](http://koha.org/) and there is a tension between

## Not Open Source

There are a number of non-open source Perl-based products. I am going to create a separate list of those too, for now let me list them here:

[Social Text](http://www.socialtext.com/). It has hosted version at [Social Text.net](http://www.socialtext.net/).
[The Perl Foundation wiki](https://www.socialtext.net/perl5/) is running on it.

[Radiator](http://www.open.com.au/radiator/) is a RADIUS server

[Live Journal](http://www.livejournal.com/) a shared blogging community system.

## Comments

Thanks for putting this list together Gabor. We need more advocacy of what great software has been written in Perl so we can support it and build a more cohesive community.

<hr>

If you do any work on the command line, then you really need to install ack. I just found it myself a few weeks ago and it's a fantastic search tool. Not only is it fast, it returns the results in a highly readable format and allows you to customize it however you like. I hadn't heard about it before, so I think this is a real gem that needs to be promoted more.

<hr>
Useful list there Gabor!

Not open source, but another Perl application to add to your separate list is MIDAS (a room booking system) https://mid.as/
