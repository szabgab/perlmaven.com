If you are attempting to install Padwalker for perl on windows,
go to your Perl Package Manager and add the following site as a place to look for perl packages:
http://www.bribes.org/perl/ppm/

This site was valid as of March 5, 2008.

In the activeperl PPM you can find the place to add sites to browse for Perl packages under

Edit---Preferences---Repositories

Once the packages get loaded up in the PPM, you can use the PPM to search and find Padwalker.
Select it , mark for installation and execute.

You have to do all this nonsense because this module is not part of the standard
perl library and EPIC decided to make it required without actually providing
it as part of its Eclipse installation. I guess they assume everyone develops on a unix or linux system.

Enjoy

I can't get Padwalker to work under Vista x64. I forced the PPM install
of PadWalker-1.7-PPM510.tar.gz, but Eclipse still complains about it not installed.

I could able to install the Padwalker successfully on Windows XP (Running Perl 5.8.x), I followed:

1) Downloaded the PadWalker.ppd from http://www.bribes.org/perl/ppm/
And it saved under C:\Perl, but default it saved as .htm extension so
I have renames the extension to .ppd (so the file name becomes C:\Perl\PadWalker.ppd) And then ran

2) C:\Perl# ppm install PadWalker.ppd

it gave error "ppm install failed: No file at C:\Perl\PadWalker-1.92-PPM58.tar.gz"

Then I have downloaded the file PadWalker-1.92-PPM58.tar.gz from
http://www.bribes.org/perl/ppm/ and saved it into C:\Perl and again ran:

<code>
C:\Perl# ppm install PadWalker.ppd
Unpacking PadWalker-1.92...done
Generating HTML for PadWalker-1.92...done
Updating files in site area...done
6 files installed
</code>

and installation was successfully. Hope this will help.

Make sure that the Module (PadWalker) filename format is:
[Module Name]-[Module Version]-[PPM Version].tar.gz

Otherwise it will keep failing with: ppm install failed: No file ...
