In the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/XML-Simple/lib/XML/Simple/FAQ.pod">FAQ</a>,
it is mentioned that in the future <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Tie::IxHash">Tie::IxHash</a> could be use in
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::Simple">XML::Simple</a>. I am using v2.18 at the moment, is there any hack to preserve the order of the data in the hashref?

=abstract end

To the above question Grant McLean, the author of XML::Simple, answered:

Retaining element order is not and never will be a feature of XML::Simple.
For some XML document types you might be able to hack it in by subclassing
XML::Simple and overriding the new_hashref() method to supply a hashref tied to Tie::IxHash.
That could solve the ABC case but it won't solve the ABA case.

The short answer is that if you care about element order then you should <b>not use XML::Simple</b>.
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::LibXML">XML::LibXML</a> is an excellent alternative which for many use cases is really no harder
to use than XML::Simple.



<h2>Sample XML file with ABA</h2>

In this example we have 3 elements inside the "order" root element. If I am not mistaken, that's what Grant referred to
when he wrote 'ABA' case.

<include file="examples/order.xml">

Using XML::Simple we can read in this XML file and immediately print it out.

<include file="examples/xml_simple_order.pl">

The result is this:

<include file="examples/order_out.xml">

The order of the elements has changed.

This might be acceptable in some cases, but in other cases the order of the elements might be important.

<h2>Dumping the XML as a Perl data structure</h2>

So why has XML::Simple messed up the order? The answer is in how it holds the data after reading the XML file.
We can use <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Data::Dumper">Data::Dumper</a> to see the content of the <hl>$xml</hl>
variable:

<include file="examples/xml_simple_order_dump.pl">

The output looks like this:

<include file="examples/order_dump_out.txt">

Here we can see that XML::Simple has merged the content of the two 'pizza' tags into one hash.
From this data structure we cannot rebuild the original order of pizza-drink-pizza.

Is this a bug in XML::Simple? You can say so, or you can say that it was a design decision.
In either way Grant, the author of the module is not planning to change this behaviour and
actually recommends agains the use of XML::Simple for new projects. Back when XML::Simple
was created it was a good  solution for a lot of problems, but today there are other solutions.
He recommended XML::LibXML.

Let's see how this round-trip works using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::LibXML">XML::LibXML</a>.

<h2>Round-trip with XML::LibXML</h2>

<include file="examples/xml_libxml_order.pl">

Running this code we'll get the XML back exactly in the same order as we had in the original file.
