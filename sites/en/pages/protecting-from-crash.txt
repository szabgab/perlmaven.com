I am not sure exactly what have I done, but suddenly, when I tried to access the development web server,
it crashed with the following error:

<code>
Error open (<:raw:encoding(UTF-8)) on '/Users/gabor/work/MetaCPAN-SCO/totals.json': No such file or directory at lib/MetaCPAN/SCO.pm line 59.
</code>

=abstract end

Right, so apparently I have removed the <hl>totals.json</hl> form the root of the application and when I tried to load the main
page it could not find the file and died when the object returned by <hl>path</hl> tried open in for reading.
We should either make lots of checks: Does the file exist? Can it be opened? Is the content JSON? Can it be converted to Perl data structure?
Or, we should wrap the whole thing in an eval-block and check if we have received an exception
from either the <hl>open</hl> or from the <hl>from_json</hl>.

Actually, at least for now, it is enough if we wrap the call in an eval-block. After all, there is not much we
can do if this fails. Maybe we should see it in a log file, but I am not sure that the web application should do
that. If this failure is caused by an unlucky timing when the file was updated by the cron-job, then it will be fixed within a second,
and if it is a permanent issue then we probably don't want our log-file to be filled with this error message.

So we only write:

<code lang="perl">
 eval {
     $vars->{totals} = from_json path("$root/totals.json")->slurp_utf8;
 };
