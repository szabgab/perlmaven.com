hi

I've generated RSA key on my Debian Lenny using:

# ssh-keygen -t rsa

and I'd like to use RSA authentication in this perl script:

<code lang="perl">
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;
use warnings;

use Net::SFTP;
use Net::SSH::Perl::Auth;

my $server="X.X.X.X";
my $user="user";
my $password="";
my %args = (
     user => "$user",
     ssh_args => {
         identity_files => [ "/home/ssh/id_rsa"],
         protocol=>'2,1'
     }
);
$args{debug} = 1;
$args{user} = "user";
my $file="TEST";
my $sftp=Net::SFTP->new($server, %args) or die "could not open connection to $server\n";
$sftp->put($file, $file) or die "could not upload a file\n";
exit;
</code>

but I'm getting the following error:

public key id_rsa.pub from the client machine was installed on the sftp server.
The user name is absolutely correct and I can login from the command line to this server and transfer a file without problems.

what's wrong?

You need to install Crypt::RSA.
