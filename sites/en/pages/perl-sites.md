It must be the age, or the lack of frequent use of some of the sites, but I keep forgetting some URLs.

I think I'd better collect here a bunch of URLs that are important for my use of Perl.

Some of them I use daily and thus I don't really need to remind myself, but can be useful for others to have.
Some others are heavily linked from MetaCPAN and that's how I get to them.

And then there are a few that I rarely use, but when I need them it would be handy to have them in one place.


[MetaCPAN](http://metacpan.org/) the search engine I use to access the data on [CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/) itself.
(There is also [search.cpan.org](http://search.cpan.org/), but IMHO it should not be recommended any more. It should be
certainly clarified that there is nothing "official" with this site. Even though it is a subdomain of cpan.org it is still an independent site.)
I rarely find a reason to go to cpan.org, though the list [most recent Perl releases](http://www.cpan.org/src/README.html) is quite useful.

[blogs.perl.org](http://blogs.perl.org/) where quite a lot  of Perl developers write and discuss stuff.

[Perl Monks](http://www.perlmonks.org/) where we can ask questions and get good answers.

[Web::Module::CoreList](http://corelist.rpee.be/) is a web interface to [Module::CoreList](https://metacpan.org/release/Module-CoreList).
When you would like to know if a module comes with the core of perl, and specifically which version of the module came with which version of Perl. (*) 

[Perly book](http://perlybook.org/) converting POD (Plain Old Documentation) to EPUB or MOBI. (No PDF yet.) (*)

[PrePAN](http://prepan.org/) I think I've never used this site, but it can be a good place to discuss a new module idea. (Along with the 
[module-authors mailing list](http://lists.perl.org/list/module-authors.html).)

[perldoc.perl.org](http://perldoc.perl.org/) provides HTML version of the standard documentation though I prefer the one
on [MetaCPAN](https://metacpan.org/release/perl). I just wish the standard PODs were integrated into MetaCPAN better
so I would not need to send people to two sites for searching.

[p3rl.org](http://p3rl.org/) is a link shortener for some Perl related pages. I don't think I have ever used it, but I know [some](http://joel-berger.com) people who love it.

[List of all Perl-related mailing lists](http://lists.perl.org/). Or at least most of them.

[Perl Mongers](http://pm.org/) list of the Perl Monger groups for when you visit a place, you can meet other Perl developers.

[Perl Weekly](http://perlweekly.com/), is one of the sites I publish together with Yanick Champoux
Once in a while I need to look up an article I remember was posted there. So I check it in the [list of all the articles](http://perlweekly.com/all.html).

[Perl Maven](https://perlmaven.com/) another site I publish, but more and more frequently I need to use the search box at the top
to locate old articles.

[Perltricks](http://perltricks.com/) written mostly by David Farrell has interesting and nicely formatted articles. This is the only other site I am aware
of (besides the Perl Maven site you are reading) where the author actually expressed a  desire to bring in more readers.

[Learning Perl](http://www.learning-perl.com/),<br>
[Effective Perl Programming](http://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/),<br>
[Mastering Perl](http://www.masteringperl.org/),<br> 
and [Programming Perl](http://www.programmingperl.org/), the sites maintained by brian d foy and branded to the respective books he wrote,
are useful for keeping up with new Perl features, as well as reading deeply analyzes about some existing functionality.

[Map of CPAN](http://mapofcpan.org/) Namespaces as tiles.

## Specialized sites

[cpXXXan](http://cpxxxan.barnyard.co.uk/) snapshots of CPAN for specific versions of Perl.

[CPAN Cover](http://cpancover.com/) - test coverage report of a number of CPAN modules generated by [Devel::Cover](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Cover).

<!--
[Perl Critic](http://www.perlcritic.com/) - 
-->

[cpan.io](http://cpan.io/) is a new site. I have no idea how well it will work out.

[CPAN Testers](http://cpantesters.org/) while it is "heavily linked" from MetaCPAN, and I visit it quite often (so I don't think
I'll forget the URL) but it might be worth mentioning separately as it has plenty of "subsites" with all kinds of extra information.

[CPANTS](http://cpants.cpanauthors.org/) provides "Kwalitee" metric for CPAN modules. (*)

[Changes CPAN HQ](http://changes.cpanhq.org/) checks if the Changes file supplied in the distribution is according to the spec. (*)

## Other

[perl.org](http://perl.org/) is called the "home of perl", but I rarely find a reason to go there.

Once in a while [perlnews.org](http://perlnews.org/) posts some news article, but unfortunately it could not gain a prominent status as the announcements on use.perl.org had.

I don't need the main site of [The Perl Foundation](http://perlfoundation.org/) too often, but I follow the news feed on [their blog](http://news.perlfoundation.org/).

The [Built in Perl](http://www.builtinperl.com/) is a nice looking site that shows a number of companies and personal projects built using Perl.
I don't frequently visit it but if you try to prove someone that others are also using Perl, this might help.

[Perlbuzz](http://perlbuzz.com/) is mostly a [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/perlbuzz) with Perl related news items that are then collected
into a weekly blog-post.

The [Perl Tips](http://perltraining.com.au/tips/) of Perl Training Australia is a collection of some very good Perl-related articles. There is also
a newsletter so you won't miss a newly published article.

[Perl and RDF](http://www.perlrdf.org/)

[Template Toolkit](http://www.template-toolkit.org/)

[Mojolicious](https://mojolicious.org/)

[Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/)

[Perl Dancer](http://perldancer.org/)

[PSGI/Plack](http://plackperl.org/)

[CPAN Minus](http://cpanmin.us/) (redirects to GitHub)

[Perlbrew](http://perlbrew.pl/)

## Perl 6

Once in a while, when I have time, I look at [Perl 6](http://perl6.org/) and at [Rakudo](http://rakudo.org/), but unfortunately I rarely have time for these.



(*) I think these sites should be (better) integrated into MetaCPAN.
