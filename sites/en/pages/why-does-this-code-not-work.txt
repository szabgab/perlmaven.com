What to do when you try to split a string and get several fields at once but it does not work?

I've received the following two examples in a short intervallum asking <b>Why does this code not work?</b>.

=abstract end

In order to answer the questions I actually need to know what is the expected result, something the person asking this question missed to provide, but luckily in these examples it seemed to be obvious.

I got two snippets and ran both of them:

<include file="examples/split_on_the_fly.pl">

(The HERE marks were in the code when I got it.)

<code>
$ perl split_on_the_fly.pl
root

</code>

In this case the author wanted to split the <hl>$str</hl> string and copy the fields
0 and 4. Effectively doing what I called <a href="/perl-split">split on the fly</a>.

<include file="examples/array_slice_not_working.pl">

<code>
$ perl array_slice_not_working.pl
root

</code>

In the second example, apparently in an attempt to simplify the code and find the problem
that way, the author has first created an array from the list returned by the
<a href="/perl-split">split</a> and then tried to use <a href="/array-slices">array slicing</a>.


The solution is in <a href="/why-does-this-code-not-work-solution">another article</a>.
