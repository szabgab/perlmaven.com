=abstract start

Just a simple example using <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Builder">Plack::Builder</a>
and <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::App::File">Plack::App::File</a>
to serve some static files using a Perl-based web server.


=abstract end

<include file="examples/static_psgi/app.psgi">

Put this in a directory as <hl>app.psgi</hl>. Put your HTML files in the 'www' subdirectory.
Run <hl>plackup</hl> and you can visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to see the pages.

In this code we use the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Middleware::DirIndex">Plack::Middleware::DirIndex</a>
middleware that handles the files in the given directory.

<h2>Comments</h2>

There is handy oneliner as well: plackup -MPlack::App::Directory -e 'Plack::App::Directory->new(root => ".")->to_app'
