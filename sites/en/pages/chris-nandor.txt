=abstract start

<a href="https://pudge.net/">Chris Nandor (Pudge)</a> is the recipient of the <a href="https://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camel/">White Came Award</> in <a href="https://www.perl.org/advocacy/white_camel/2000.html">2000</a>.

As I have not heard much from him in recent years I thought it would be interesting to ask where is he now and what does he do.

<h2>When and how did you first start using Perl?</h2>

I started in 1995. I had just gotten my degree in journalism, and I got a job at
a company doing content for their web site. But there wasn’t enough content work
to do, so I read Learning Perl and started helping to write code for the site.
 
<h2>Do you still use it? If yes for what?</h2>

I use it pretty much every day for my job. It’s been a major part of my work
with every job I’ve had since I started. This job is about 90% Perl, most of the
time (although the project I just finished up was mostly React). It is mostly
web sites, and tools supporting that work, including backend processes.

 
<h2>What was the impact of Perl on your life?</h2>


Helped me support my family with a great career, and meet lots of interesting
people, including some great friends to this day.

 
<h2>What do you do these days?</h2>

Other than work (mostly in Perl), I am raising a family of five kids with my
wife in South Dakota, coaching youth ice hockey, and playing and writing music.
I am getting back to my roots (my journalism degree) and writing a book about
media literacy ("Don't Trust: Verify"). Last year I coauthored a memoir with Max
Sotodeh, a friend of mine, about his escape from Iran in the 1980s, after being
a student in the revolution and a soldier in the war. I don’t do a lot of
programming in my spare time, except for the occasional personal project.

 
<h2>Are there any "communities" you participate in? (open source, non-profit, etc.) Tell me about it.</h2>

Not tech-related, no. I don’t personally get much benefit from those communities
anymore, and I dropped out primarily for that reason. It is not that I know
everything, but I usually know enough to do what I need to do, and to figure out
what I don’t know.  Plus, as my family grew, I had less time, and I dropped many
things out of my life, including non tech-related groups, video gaming, etc.
There was also — in certain parts of various tech communities — a growing
hostile and intolerant element that I didn’t wish to be around. So I had fewer
reasons to remain, and more reasons to leave.

 
<h2>What would you suggest a Perl programmer to learn and to do to stay employable?</h2>


Be flexible and curious. At one job I had that was mostly Perl, we needed to
modify some Java code, so I spent several weeks on that project; then we had
needs that took me primarily into Bash and Python for months. At my current job,
we had a C# system I needed to work on. I still do a ton of Perl, but as long as
I am doing what the company needs, I am fine with it.
