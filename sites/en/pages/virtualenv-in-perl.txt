Virtualenv is a great tool in Python that allows the user to separate the 3rd-part package installations of various projects.

When we have multiple projects on the same system using the same modules but requiring different versions we have a problem.

We need to be able to install two different version of the same module. Perl 5 does not provide a way to do this.

<h2>The solution with CPAN Minus</h2>

<code>
cd project_root/

export PERL5LIB=venv/lib/perl5
export PATH=venv/bin/:$PATH
cpanm -l venv/ --installdeps .
</code>

CPAN Minus is one of the clients of CPAN that makes module installation easy. We just type in

<code>
cpanm Module::Name
</code>

and it will install the module.

If we have a <hl>Makefile.PL</hl> that lists all the dependencies of our project we can then use

<code>
cpanm --installdeps .
</code>

to install all the dependencies of our project.

Using the <hl>-l</hl> flag we can tell <hl>cpanm</hl> where to install the modules.

If we would like to use the <hl>venv</hl> (any arbitrary directory name would work) directory
inside the root of our project we can pass <hl>-l venv</hl> to <hl>cpanm</hl> and it will
install the modules in that directory.

We also want to make sure the modules that were installed can be found.
This is important any time a module is to be used, including when it is used during
the installation of another module depending on it.
So we assign the appropriate value relative to the <hl>venv</hl> directory:

<code>
export PERL5LIB=venv/lib/perl5
</code>

<b>before</b> we try to install modules.


Finally, some modules will install executables in the <hl>venv/bin</hl> directory.
We would want the command line to find them:

<code>
export PATH=venv/bin/:$PATH
</code>
