While Perl arrays can only be one-dimensionals, each value can be a reference to another array and then it could look
like as if it was a 2 or more dimansional array.

If each element of an array is a reference to another array, and if each one of the internal arrays has the same number
of elements then it will look like a matrix.

A matrix can be transposed. (Replace the rows by arrays.)
