=abstract start

<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph">GD::Graph</a> makes it easy to create various types of
graphs using Perl. The distribution comes with an extensive set of examples. In this article we are
going to see a bar-graph and how various parameters impact its look.

We'll start with a script with a number of commented out and then one by one we're going to enable each one
of the parameters. In the meantime we will keep the data (mostly) the same.

=abstract end

This code is based on the <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/GDGraph">sample11.pl</a> file included included
in the distribution.

<include file="examples/gdgraph_bars.pl">

After loading the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph::Data">GD::Graph::Data</a> module that represents the
raw data, and the <hl>GD::Graph::bars</hl> module that handles the creation of the vertical bar-graphs, we create the data.
The first array reference holds the values of the x-axis, the second array reference holds the corresponding values
of the y-axis.

Then we create a <hl>GD::Graph::bars</hl> object. Set some parameters and call the <hl>plot</hl> method that
draws the image. At the end we call <hl>$graph->gd->png</hl> that exports the image in <b>PNG</b> format.
In this example we save the image in a file, but if this was a web environment we might just return the image.

Running the script will generated the following graph:

<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_plain.png" alt="just a bar graph created by Perl GD::Graph" />

It is a bit "bulky", but we can clearly see the values on the x-axis we provided in the data.
It is clear that the content of the <hl>title</hl> parameter is at the top of the graph and the values of the
<hl>x_label</hl> and <hl>y_label</hl> parameters were added under the x-axis and next to the y-axis respectively.

Let's see what happens as we enable the rest of the parameters one-by-one.

<h2>y_max_value</h2>

In the previous graph the y-axis ran from 0 to 10. I am not sure why did it run exactly to 10, it is somehow
calculated from the max value that needs to be displayed. (In a simple experiment I changed one of the values to 12
and the y-axis ran up to 25.) In any case, if you are not satisfied with the max y-axis value calculated by the module,
you can supply your own number using th
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph#y_max_value-y_min_value">y_max_value</a> parameter.
We set it to 7 and got the following result:

<code lang="perl">
    y_max_value     => 7,
</code>
 
<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_y_max_value.png" alt="y_max_value set" />

<h2>y_tick_number</h2>

If you look at the y-axis of the previous graphs, you'll see there are 5 numbers above the 0
4 of them with little "ticks" and the 5th is the max-value of the y-axis.

The number of ticks is controlled by the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph#y_tick_number">y_tick_number</a>
parameter. It defaults to 5, but for the next graph we set it to be 8 and indeed we now have 8 numbers above the 0
including the max value of the y-axis.

These ticks can make it easier to see how tall each one of the bars is.

<code lang="perl">
    y_tick_number   => 8,
</code>

<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_y_tick_number.png" alt="y_tick_number set" />

<h2>y_label_skip</h2>

While having many ticks and corresponding y-values can make it easier to read
the graph, but if we have two many of them then the graph might get ugly or
the numbers might become unreadable. An alternative that you can see employed
in many places is to have many ticks, but show the numbers only at some of them.

The <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph#x_label_skip-y_label_skip">y_label_skip</a> parameter
controls this behavior. Though the name of the parameter is probably incorrect because the value of
this parameter defines which ticks should have a number as well. <hl>y_label_skip => 2</hl> means
show the number on every second tick, <hl>y_label_skip => 3</hl> means show the number on every 3rd
tick, etc. (It defaults to 1, showing the number on every tick.)

<code lang="perl">
    y_label_skip    => 3,
</code>

<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_y_label_skip.png" alt="y_label_skip set" />

<h2>x_labels_vertical</h2>

Looking back at the previous graphs, you can see that the values on the x-axis were readable.
(Well, if you have good eyes or good glasses.).
What if the values are longer than what would fit under a single bar? In that case the values
of the x-axis would overlap and we would not be able to read them. In order to demonstrate this,
I have changed the data to have longer values for the third and fourth column:

<code lang="perl">
    ["1st","2nd","third value","fourth value","5th","6th","7th", "8th", "9th"],
</code>

and generated the graph again. Here the text of those two columns overlap and is not readable.

<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_x_labels_not_vertical.png" alt="x_labels_vertical not set" />


That's where the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph#x_labels_vertical">x_labels_vertical</a>
is useful. It is a boolean flag and by default is 0 (meaning off). If we set it to some
<a href="/boolean-values-in-perl">true value</a> (for example 1) then the names will be printed vertically.
This means we might need to tilt our head to read them, but at least they don't overlap each other:

<code lang="perl">
    x_labels_vertical => 1,
</code>

<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_x_labels_vertical.png" alt="x_labels_vertical set" />

<h2>bar_spacing</h2>

By default the bars touch each other. This makes the graph a bit bulky. The 
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph#bar_spacing">bar_spacing</a> parameter
allows us to set the number of pixels between the bars. We set it to 20 that made
the bars to be very thin. This is probably too much for this graph.

<code lang="perl">
    bar_spacing => 20,
</code>

<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_bar_spacing.png" alt="bar_spacing set" />

A value of 10 would probably look better:

<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_bar_spacing_10.png" alt="bar_spacing set" />

<h2>shadow_depth</h2>

In order for the bars to be more live (more 3D-like) we can add shadow. The shadow can be
either on the right side or the left side of the bar. The <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph#shadow_depth">shadow_depth</a>
variable controls how many pixels the shadow will use and in which direction. A positive number will create a shadow
to the right, as can be seen in our result:

<code lang="perl">
    shadow_depth    => 4,
</code>

<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_shadow_depth.png" alt="shadow_depth set" />

A negative number (-4 in this case) would put the shadow to the left:

<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_shadow_depth_left.png" alt="shadow_depth set" />

If the <hl>shadow_depth</hl> is bigger than the <hl>bar_spacing</hl> this looks awkward.

<h2>shadowclr = dred</h2>

The <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph#bgclr-fgclr-boxclr-accentclr-shadowclr">shadowclr</a> parameter
allows us to set the colour (with the u) of the shadow. The example that came with the module used
the colour called dred which I've never heard off, but looks like some deep-red. In any
case the values needs to be one of the
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph::colour">GD::Graph::colour</a>predefined colours</a>.

<code lang="perl">
    shadowclr       => 'dred',
</code>

<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_shadowclr_dred.png" alt="shadowclr set to dred" />

<h2>transparent</h2>

By default the background of the graph is going to be transparent. On this page the background
is white and thus the background of the graphs is also white.
We can turn off transparency by setting the boolean parameter
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph#transparent">transparent</a>
to 0.

<code lang="perl">
    transparent     => 0,
</code>

Drawing the graph again won't show any difference though.

<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_transparent.png" alt="transparent set" />

What if we show the last two images but set the background of the HTML page to red using the background-color
property of CSS. The left graph is drawn with the default value of <hl>transparent</hl> (which is 1)
and thus we see through the graph and see the red background of the HTML page.
The right graph is drawn with transparency turned off <hl>transparent=0</hl> and so it has the background
of the drawing itself.

<div style="background-color: red; padding: 20px; width: 850px">
<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_shadowclr_dred.png" alt="shadowclr set to dred" />
<img src="/img/gdgraph/bars_transparent.png" alt="transparent set" />
</div>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

There are even more parameters one can set for a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/GD::Graph">GD::Graph</a>
and there are plenty more examples.


<h2>Comments</h2>

thank you very much

How to change the bar coloue?

Thank you this helped me a lot :)
