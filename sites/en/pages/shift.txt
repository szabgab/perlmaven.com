=abstract start

The <hl>shift</hl> function in Perl will remove the first value of the array passed to it and return it.

=abstract end

<code lang="perl">
my @names = ('Foo', 'Bar', 'Moo');
my $first = shift @names;
print "$first\n";     # Foo
print "@names\n";     # Bar Moo
</code>

Note, the array itself got shorter. The first element was removed from it!

<h2>shift without parameters</h2>

In case no array is passed to it, <hl>shift</hl> has two defaults  depending on the location of <hl>shift</hl>.

If <hl>shift</hl> is outside any function it takes the first element of <hl>@ARGV</hl> (the parameter list of the program).

<include file="examples/shift_argv.pl">

<code>
$ perl examples/shift_argv.pl one two
one
</code>

If shift is inside a function it takes the first element of <hl>@_</hl> (the parameter list of the function).


<include file="examples/shift_in_sub.pl">

<code>
$ perl examples/shift_in_sub.pl one two
hello
</code>

Here <hl>shift</hl> disregarded the content of <hl>@ARGV</hl> and took the first element of <hl>@_</hl>, the array
holding the parameters passed to the function.

<h2>Shift on empty array</h2>

If the array <hl>shift</hl> works on is empty, then <hl>shift</hl> will return <hl>undef</hl>.

Regardless if the array was explicitely given to it or implicely selected based on the location of <hl>shift</hl>.

See <a href="https://perlmaven.com/beginner-perl-maven-shift-and-unshift">video explaining shift and unshift</a>
or the example <a href="https://perlmaven.com/beginner-perl-maven-shift">using shift to get first parameter of a script</a>.

What about this?

Hi Gabor,
As a beginner of Perl scripting, I have been reading your tutorials for sometime now. I am always amazed by your simple and to the point explanation of complex concepts. I am not even a real coder- just a grad student making some boring tasks interesting by learning new and appropriate languages. Thanks for being supper clear and your dedication to help others. - Ze

I am glad I can help!

<hr>

What about shift with a hash reference?

if ( !checkusage(\%opts) ) {
usage();
}
sub checkusage {
my $opts_ref = shift;
...do something with $opts_ref
}

<hr>

Please I need your help:
I han been create the next variable:
my @dias=('2023-01-01','2023-01-02','2023-01-03');
my $cadena_promedio= "obtener_promedios(\\%HoH,";
foreach my $d (@dias){
$cadena_promedio.="\'$d\', ";
}
$cadena_promedio.=");";

&obtener_promedios(\\%HoH, '2023-01-01','2su023-01-02','2023-01-03',);

sub obtener_promedio{
my $HoH= shift;
my @dates= @_;
}

Please, what will be the value for the variables $HoH and @dates:

THANKS A LOT.
REGARDS
