Neil Bowers is a long time Perl programmer, and has managed all sorts of developers, including Perl ones.

He is also a prolific Perl blogger who writes articles comparing 10-20 Perl modules that are supposed to
do the same task. Offering a step in the direction of CPAN curation.

He is also the joint owner of a small bootstrapped Perl-based start-up company.

<p>
Some of the things Neil talked about:
<ul>
<li>Put links to competing / similar / complementary modules in the <b>SEE ALSO</b> section of your module.</li>
<li>Help other people to solve their problems to get a reputation for being helpful, being a good programmer.
    Helping other people is the best way to make sure you understand the technology.
    Try <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tags/perl">Perl on Stack Overflow</a>.
    <a href="http://questhub.io">Questhub</a> is a good way to encourage people and to offer help and advice, without waiting for someone to ask a specific question.
<li>Having a clear goal and thinking how to get from here to there. Breaking things down in smaller sized chunks, keep them on a list, or in Questhub.</li>
</ul>
